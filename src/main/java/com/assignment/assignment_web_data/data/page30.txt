Austroasiatic languages The Austroasiatic languages in recent classifications synonymous with Mon Khmer are a large language family of continental Southeast Asia also scattered throughout India Bangladesh and the southern border of China The name Austroasiatic comes from the Latin words for south and Asia hence South Asia Among these languages only Khmer Vietnamese and Mon have a recorded history and only Vietnamese and Khmer have official status in Vietnam and Cambodia respectively The rest of the languages are spoken by minority groups Ethnologue identifies Austroasiatic languages These form thirteen established families plus perhaps Shompen which is poorly attested as a fourteenth which have traditionally been grouped into two as Mon Khmer and Munda However one recent classification posits three groups Munda Nuclear and while another has abandoned Mon Khmer as a taxon altogether making it synonymous with the larger family Austroasiatic languages have a disjunct distribution across India Bangladesh and Southeast Asia separated by regions where other languages are spoken They appear to be the autochthonous languages of Southeast Asia with the neighboring Tai Dravidian Austronesian and languages being the result of later migrations Sidwell Blench Typology The Austroasiatic languages are well known for having a sesquisyllabic pattern with basic nouns and verbs consisting of a reduced minor syllable plus a full syllable Many of them also have infixes The Austroasiatic languages are further characterized as having unusually large vowel inventories and employing some sort of register contrast either between modal normal voice and breathy lax voice or between modal voice and creaky voice Languages in the Pearic branch and some in the Vietic branch can have a three or even voicing contrast However some Austroasiatic languages have lost the register contrast by evolving more diphthongs or in a few cases such as Vietnamese tonogenesis Much work has been done on the reconstruction of Khmer in Harry Shorto Mon Khmer Comparative Dictionary Little work has been done on the Munda languages which are not well documented With their demotion from a primary branch Khmer becomes synonymous with Paul Sidwell reconstructs the consonant inventory of Khmer as follows This is identical to earlier reconstructions except for is better preserved in the Katuic languages which Sidwell has specialized in Sidwell suggests that the likely homeland of Austroasiatic is the middle Mekong in the area of the Bahnaric and Katuic languages approximately where modern Laos Thailand and Cambodia come together and that the family is not as old as frequently assumed dating to perhaps BCE Classification Linguists traditionally recognize two primary divisions of Austroasiatic the Mon Khmer languages of Southeast Asia Northeast India and the Nicobar Islands and the Munda languages of East and Central India and parts of Bangladesh However no evidence for this classification has ever been published Each of the families that is written in boldface type below is accepted as a valid clade By contrast the relationships between these families within Austroasiatic is debated In addition to the traditional classification two recent proposals are given neither of which accept traditional Mon Khmer as a valid unit However little of the data used for competing classifications has ever been published and therefore can not be evaluated by peer review In addition there are suggestions that additional branches of Austroasiatic might be preserved in substrata of Acehnese in Sumatra Diffloth the Chamic languages of Vietnam and the Land Dayak languages of Borneo Adelaar Sidwell Paul Sidwell in a lexicostatistical comparison of languages which are enough to exclude loan words finds little evidence for internal branching though he did find an area of increased contact between the Bahnaric and Katuic languages such that languages of all branches apart from the geographically distant Munda and Nicobarese show greater similarity to Bahnaric and Katuic the closer they are to those branches without any noticeable innovations common to Bahnaric and Katuic He therefore takes the conservative view that the thirteen branches of Austroasiatic should be treated as equidistant on current evidence Sidwell Blench discuss this proposal in more detail and note that there is good evidence for a Khasi Palaungic node which could also possibly be closely related to Khmuic If this would the case Sidwell Blench suggest that Khasic may have been an early offshoot of Palaungic that had spread westward Sidwell Blench suggest Shompen as an additional branch and believe that a connection is worth investigating In general however the family is thought to have diversified too quickly for a deeply nested structure to have developed since speakers are believed by Sidwell to have radiated out from the central Mekong River valley relatively quickly Roger Blench also proposes that there may have been other Austroasiatic branches that are now extinct based on substrate evidence in languages G rard Diffloth Diffloth compares reconstructions of various clades and attempts to classify them based on shared innovations though like other classifications the evidence has not been published As a schematic we have Or in more detail This family tree is consistent with recent studies of migration of haplogroup However the dates obtained from by Zhivotovsky method DNA studies are several times older than that given by linguists The route map of the people with haplogroup speaking this language can be seen in this link Other geneticists criticise the Zhivotovsky method Ilia Peiros Peiros is a lexicostatistic classification based on percentages of shared vocabulary This means that a language may appear to be more distantly related than it actually is due to language contact Indeed when Sidwell replicated Peiros study with languages known well enough to account for loans he did not find the internal branching structure below Diffloth Diffloth widely cited original classification now abandoned by Diffloth himself is used in Encyclop dia Britannica and except for the breakup of Southern Mon Khmer in Ethnologue Writing systems Other than alphabets many Austroasiatic languages are written with the ancient Khmer alphabet Thai alphabet and Lao alphabet Vietnamese divergently had an indigenous script based on Chinese logographic writing This has since been supplanted by the Latin alphabet in the century The following are examples of alphabets or current alphabets of Austroasiatic languages Further reading Mann Noel Wendy Smith and Eva Ujlakyova Linguistic clusters of Mainland Southeast Asia an overview of the language families
