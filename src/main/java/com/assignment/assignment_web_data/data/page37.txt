Alaska Alaska is a state situated in the northwest extremity of the North American continent Bordering the state to the east is Yukon a Canadian territory and the Canadian province of British Columbia the Arctic Ocean to the north and the Pacific Ocean to the west and south with Russia specifically Chukotka Autonomous Okrug and Kamchatka Krai further west across the Bering Strait Alaska is the largest state in the United States by area the least populous and the least densely populated of the United States Approximately half of Alaska residents live within the Anchorage metropolitan area Alaska economy is dominated by the oil natural gas and fishing industries resources which it has in abundance Tourism is also a significant part of the economy Although it had been occupied for thousands of years by indigenous peoples from the century onward European powers considered the territory of Alaska ripe for exploitation and trade The United States purchased Alaska from the Russian Empire on March for million adjusted for inflation at approximately two cents per acre km The area went through several administrative changes before becoming organized as a territory on May It was admitted as the state of the on January The name Alaska had been introduced in the Russian colonial period when it was used to refer to the peninsula It was derived from an Aleut or Unangam idiom which figuratively refers to the mainland of Alaska Literally it means object to which the action of the sea is directed It is also known as Alyeska the great land an Aleut word derived from the same root Geography Alaska has a longer coastline than all the other states combined It is the only state on continental North America about of British Columbia Canada separates Alaska from Washington Alaska is thus an exclave of the United States possibly the largest exclave in the world It is technically part of the continental but is often not included in colloquial use Alaska is not part of the contiguous often called the Lower The capital city Juneau is situated on the mainland of the North American continent but is not connected by road to the rest of the North American highway system The state is bordered by Yukon and British Columbia in Canada to the east the Gulf of Alaska and the Pacific Ocean to the south the Bering Sea Bering Strait and Chukchi Sea to the west and the Arctic Ocean to the north Alaska territorial waters touch Russia territorial waters in the Bering Strait as the Russian Big Diomede Island and Alaskan Little Diomede Island are only apart With the extension of the Aleutian Islands into the eastern hemisphere it is technically both the westernmost and easternmost state in the United States as well as also being the northernmost Alaska is the largest state in the United States in land area at over twice the size of Texas the next largest state Alaska is larger than all but sovereign countries Counting territorial waters Alaska is larger than the combined area of the next three largest states Texas California and Montana It is also larger than the combined area of the smallest states Regions There are no officially defined borders demarcating the various regions of Alaska but there are six widely accepted regions South Central The most populous region of Alaska containing Anchorage the Valley and the Kenai Peninsula Rural mostly unpopulated areas south of the Alaska Range and west of the Wrangell Mountains also fall within the definition of Southcentral as well as the Prince William Sound area and the communities of Cordova and Valdez Southeast Also referred to as the Panhandle or Inside Passage this is the region of Alaska closest to the rest of the United States As such this was where most of the initial settlement occurred in the years following the Alaska Purchase The region is dominated by the Alexander Archipelago as well as the Tongass National Forest the largest national forest in the United States It contains the state capital Juneau the former capital Sitka and Ketchikan at one time Alaska largest city The Alaska Marine Highway provides a vital surface transportation link throughout the area as only three communities Haines Hyder and Skagway enjoy direct connections to the contiguous North American road system Interior The largest region of Alaska much of the interior is uninhabited wilderness Fairbanks is the only large city in the region Small towns and Alaska Native villages are scattered throughout mostly along the highway and river systems Denali National Park and Preserve is located here home to Mount McKinley also widely known by its local name of Denali the highest point in North America Southwest Southwest Alaska is a sparsely inhabited region stretching some inland from the Bering Sea Most of the population lives along the coast Kodiak Island is also located in Southwest The massive Yukon Kuskokwim Delta one of the largest river deltas in the world is here Portions of the Alaska Peninsula are considered part of Southwest with the remaining portions included with the Aleutian Islands see below North Slope The North Slope is mostly tundra peppered with small villages The area is known for its massive reserves of crude oil and contains both the National Petroleum Reserve Alaska and the Prudhoe Bay Oil Field Barrow the northernmost city in the United States is located here The Northwest Arctic area anchored by Kotzebue and also containing the Kobuk River valley is often regarded as being part of this region However the respective Inupiat of the North Slope and of the Northwest Arctic seldom consider themselves to be one people Aleutian Islands More than small volcanic islands make up this chain which stretches over into the Pacific Ocean The International Date Line was drawn west of to keep the whole state and thus the entire North American continent within the same legal day However because some of these islands fall in the Eastern Hemisphere this makes Alaska the northernmost easternmost and westernmost state in the union with the southernmost state being Hawaii Two of the islands Attu and Kiska were occupied by Japanese forces during World War II Natural features With its myriad islands Alaska has nearly of tidal shoreline The Aleutian Islands chain extends west from the southern tip of the Alaska Peninsula Many active volcanoes are found in the Aleutians and in coastal regions Unimak Island for example is home to Mount Shishaldin which is an occasionally smoldering volcano that rises to above the North Pacific It is the most perfect volcanic cone on Earth even more symmetrical than Japan Mount Fuji The chain of volcanoes extends to Mount Spurr west of Anchorage on the mainland Geologists have identified Alaska as part of Wrangellia a large region consisting of multiple states and Canadian provinces in the Pacific Northwest which is actively undergoing continent building One of the world largest tides occurs in Turnagain Arm just south of Anchorage tidal differences can be more than Alaska has more than three million and wetland permafrost cover mostly in northern western and southwest flatlands Glacier ice covers some of land and of tidal zone The Bering Glacier complex near the southeastern border with Yukon covers alone With over glaciers Alaska has half of all in the world Land ownership According to an October report by the United States Bureau of Land Management approximately of Alaska is owned and managed by the federal government as public lands including a multitude of national forests national parks and national wildlife refuges Of these the Bureau of Land Management manages or of the state The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is managed by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service It is the world largest wildlife refuge comprising Of the remaining land area the state of Alaska owns its entitlement under the Alaska Statehood Act A portion of that acreage is occasionally ceded to organized boroughs under the statutory provisions pertaining to newly formed boroughs Smaller portions are set aside for rural subdivisions and other opportunities These are not very popular due to the often remote and roadless locations The University of Alaska as a land grant university also owns substantial acreage which it manages independently Another are owned by regional and scores of local Native corporations created under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act ANCSA of Regional Native corporation Doyon Limited often promotes itself as the largest private landowner in Alaska in advertisements and other communications Provisions of ANCSA allowing the corporations land holdings to be sold on the open market starting in were repealed before they could take effect Effectively the corporations hold title including subsurface title in many cases a privilege denied to individual Alaskans but can not sell the land Individual Native allotments can be and are sold on the open market however Various private interests own the remaining land totaling about one percent of the state Alaska is by a large margin the state with the smallest percentage of private land ownership when Native corporation holdings are excluded Climate The climate in Southeast Alaska is a oceanic climate K ppen climate classification Cfb in the southern sections and a subarctic oceanic climate K ppen Cfc in the northern parts On an annual basis Southeast is both the wettest and warmest part of Alaska with milder temperatures in the winter and high precipitation throughout the year Juneau averages over of precipitation a year and Ketchikan averages over This is also the only region in Alaska in which the average daytime high temperature is above freezing during the winter months The climate of Anchorage and south central Alaska is mild by Alaskan standards due to the region proximity to the seacoast While the area gets less rain than southeast Alaska it gets more snow and days tend to be clearer On average Anchorage receives of precipitation a year with around of snow although there are areas in the south central which receive far more snow It is a subarctic climate due to its brief cool summers The climate of Western Alaska is determined in large part by the Bering Sea and the Gulf of Alaska It is a subarctic oceanic climate in the southwest and a continental subarctic climate farther north The temperature is somewhat moderate considering how far north the area is This region has a tremendous amount of variety in precipitation An area stretching from the northern side of the Seward Peninsula to the Kobuk River valley the region around Kotzebue Sound is technically a desert with portions receiving less than of precipitation annually On the other extreme some locations between Dillingham and Bethel average around of precipitation The climate of the interior of Alaska is subarctic Some of the highest and lowest temperatures in Alaska occur around the area near Fairbanks The summers may have temperatures reaching into the F the C while in the winter the temperature can fall below Precipitation is sparse in the Interior often less than a year but what precipitation falls in the winter tends to stay the entire winter The highest and lowest recorded temperatures in Alaska are both in the Interior The highest is in Fort Yukon which is just inside the arctic circle on June making Alaska tied with Hawaii as the state with the lowest high temperature in the United States The lowest official Alaska temperature is in Prospect Creek on January one degree above the lowest temperature recorded in continental North America in Snag Yukon Canada The climate in the extreme north of Alaska is Arctic with long very cold winters and short cool summers Even in July the average low temperature in Barrow is Precipitation is light in this part of Alaska with many places averaging less than per year mostly as snow which stays on the ground almost the entire year History Alaska natives Numerous indigenous peoples occupied Alaska for thousands of years before the arrival of European peoples to the area Linguistic and DNA studies done here have provided evidence for the settlement of North America by way of the Bering land bridge The Tlingit people developed a society with a matrilineal kinship system of property inheritance and descent in what is today Southeast Alaska along with parts of British Columbia and the Yukon Also in Southeast were the Haida now well known for their unique arts The Tsimshian people came to Alaska from British Columbia in when President Grover Cleveland and later the Congress granted them permission to settle on Annette Island and found the town of Metlakatla All three of these peoples as well as other indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast experienced smallpox outbreaks from the late through the century with the most devastating epidemics occurring in the and resulting in high fatalities and social disruption The Aleutian Islands are still home to the Aleut people seafaring society although they were the first Native Alaskans to be exploited by Russians Western and Southwestern Alaska are home to the Yup ik while their cousins the Alutiiq Sugpiaq lived in what is now Southcentral Alaska The Gwich in people of the northern Interior region are Athabaskan and primarily known today for their dependence on the caribou within the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge The North Slope and Little Diomede Island are occupied by the widespread Inupiat people Colonization Some researchers believe that the first Russian settlement in Alaska was established in the century According to this hypothesis in several koches of Semyon Dezhnyov expedition came ashore in Alaska by storm and founded this settlement This hypothesis is based on the testimony of Chukchi geographer Nikolai Daurkin who had visited Alaska in and who had reported on a village on the Kheuveren River populated by bearded men who pray to the icons Some modern researchers associate Kheuveren with Koyuk River The first European vessel to reach Alaska is generally held to be the Gabriel under the authority of the surveyor Gvozdev and assistant navigator Fyodorov on August during an expedition of Siberian cossak Shestakov and Belorussian explorer Dmitry Pavlutsky Another European contact with Alaska occurred in when Vitus Bering led an expedition for the Russian Navy aboard the Peter After his crew returned to Russia with sea otter pelts judged to be the finest fur in the world small associations of fur traders began to sail from the shores of Siberia toward the Aleutian Islands The first permanent European settlement was founded in Between and Spain sent several expeditions to Alaska in order to assert its claim over the Pacific Northwest In a Spanish settlement and fort were built in Nootka Sound These expeditions gave names to places such as Valdez Bucareli Sound and Cordova Later the Company carried out an expanded colonization program during the century Sitka renamed New Archangel from to on Baranof Island in the Alexander Archipelago in what is now Southeast Alaska became the capital of Russian America It remained the capital after the colony was transferred to the United States The Russians never fully colonized Alaska and the colony was never very profitable Evidence of Russian settlement in names and churches survive throughout southeast Alaska William Seward the United States Secretary of State negotiated the Alaska Purchase also known as Seward Folly with the Russians in for million Alaska was loosely governed by the military initially and was administered as a district starting in with a governor appointed by the President of the United States A federal district court was headquartered in Sitka For most of Alaska first decade under the United States flag Sitka was the only community inhabited by American settlers They organized a provisional city government which was Alaska first municipal government but not in a legal sense Legislation allowing Alaskan communities to legally incorporate as cities did not come about until and home rule for cities was extremely limited or unavailable until statehood took effect in Territory Starting in the and stretching in some places to the early gold rushes in Alaska and the nearby Yukon Territory brought thousands of miners and settlers to Alaska Alaska was officially incorporated as an organized territory in Alaska capital which had been in Sitka until was moved north to Juneau Construction of the Alaska Governor Mansion began that same year European immigrants from Norway and Sweden also settled in southeast Alaska where they entered the fishing and logging industries During World War II the Aleutian Islands Campaign focused on the three outer Aleutian Islands Attu Agattu and Kiska that were invaded by Japanese troops and occupied between June and August Harbor became a significant base for the Army Air Forces and Navy submariners The program involved the flying of American warplanes through Canada to Fairbanks and thence Nome Soviet pilots took possession of these aircraft ferrying them to fight the German invasion of the Soviet Union The construction of military bases contributed to the population growth of some Alaskan cities Statehood Statehood for Alaska was an important cause of James Wickersham early in his tenure as a congressional delegate Decades later the statehood movement gained its first real momentum following a territorial referendum in The Alaska Statehood Committee and Alaska Constitutional Convention would soon follow Statehood supporters also found themselves fighting major battles against political foes mostly in the Congress but also within Alaska Statehood was approved by Congress on July Alaska was officially proclaimed a state on January In the Census Bureau reported Alaska population as White Black and American Indian and Alaska Native On March the massive Good Friday Earthquake killed people and destroyed several villages and portions of large coastal communities mainly by the resultant tsunamis and landslides It was the earthquake in the recorded history of the world with a moment magnitude of It was over one thousand times more powerful than the San Francisco earthquake The time of day pm time of year and location of the epicenter were all cited as factors in potentially sparing thousands of lives particularly in Anchorage The discovery of oil at Prudhoe Bay and the completion of the Pipeline led to an oil boom Royalty revenues from oil have funded large state budgets from onward That same year not coincidentally Alaska repealed its state income tax In the Exxon Valdez hit a reef in the Prince William Sound spilling over of crude oil over of coastline Today the battle between philosophies of development and conservation is seen in the contentious debate over oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and the proposed Pebble Mine Alaska Heritage Resources Survey The Alaska Heritage Resources Survey AHRS is a restricted inventory of all reported historic and prehistoric sites within the state of Alaska and is maintained by the Office of History and Archaeology The survey inventory of cultural resources includes objects structures buildings sites districts and travel ways with a general provision that they are over years old As of January over sites have been reported Demographics The United States Census Bureau estimates that the population of Alaska was on July a increase since the United States Census In Alaska ranked as the state by population ahead of North Dakota Vermont and Wyoming and Washington Alaska is the least densely populated state and one of the most sparsely populated areas in the world at with the next state Wyoming at Alaska is the largest state by area and the tenth wealthiest per capita income As of November the state unemployment rate was Race and ancestry According to the United States Census Alaska had a population of In terms of race and ethnicity the state was White White American Indian and Alaska Native Asian Black or African American Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander from Some Other Race and from Two or More Races Hispanics or Latinos of any race made up of the population of Alaska population younger than one year of age belonged to minority groups did not have two parents of white ancestry Languages According to the American Community Survey of people over the age of five speak only English at home About speak Spanish at home About speak another language at home and about speak an Asian language at home About speak other languages at home The Alaska Native Language Center at the University of Alaska Fairbanks claims that at least Alaskan native languages exist and there are also some languages with different dialects Most of Alaska native languages belong to either the Eskimo Aleut or language families however some languages are thought to be isolates Haida or have not yet been classified Tsimshianic A total of of Alaskans speak one of the state indigenous languages known locally as native languages As the homeland of these two major language families of North America Alaska has been described as the crossroads of the continent In October the governor of Alaska signed a bill declaring the state indigenous languages as official languages Religion According to statistics collected by the Association of Religion Data Archives from about of Alaska residents were members of religious congregations people identified as Evangelical Protestants as Roman Catholic and as mainline Protestants Roughly are Mormon are Jewish are Muslim are Buddhist and are Hindu The largest religious denominations in Alaska were the Catholic Church with adherents Evangelical Protestants with adherents The Church of Jesus Christ of Saints with adherents and the Southern Baptist Convention with adherents In the First Russian Orthodox Church was established in Kodiak Intermarriage with Alaskan Natives helped the Russian immigrants integrate into society As a result an increasing number of Russian Orthodox churches gradually became established within Alaska Alaska also has the largest Quaker population by percentage of any state In there were Jews in Alaska for whom observance of halakha may pose special problems Estimates for the number of Alaskan Muslims range from to In the local Muslim community broke ground on the first mosque in the state Alaskan Hindus often share venues and celebrations with members of other Asian religious communities including Sikhs and Jains Alaska has been identified along with Pacific Northwest states Washington and Oregon as being the least religious states of the USA in terms of church membership Economy The gross state product was billion in the nation Its per capita personal income for was ranking in the nation According to a study by Phoenix Marketing International Alaska had the number of millionaires per capita in the United States with a ratio of percent The oil and gas industry dominates the Alaskan economy with more than of the state revenues derived from petroleum extraction Alaska main export product excluding oil and natural gas is seafood primarily salmon cod Pollock and crab Agriculture represents a very small fraction of the Alaskan economy Agricultural production is primarily for consumption within the state and includes nursery stock dairy products vegetables and livestock Manufacturing is limited with most foodstuffs and general goods imported from elsewhere Employment is primarily in government and industries such as natural resource extraction shipping and transportation Military bases are a significant component of the economy in both Fairbanks and Anchorage Federal subsidies are also an important part of the economy allowing the state to keep taxes low Its industrial outputs are crude petroleum natural gas coal gold precious metals zinc and other mining seafood processing timber and wood products There is also a growing service and tourism sector Tourists have contributed to the economy by supporting local lodging Energy Alaska has vast energy resources although its oil reserves have been largely depleted Major oil and gas reserves were found in the Alaska North Slope ANS and Cook Inlet basins but according to the Energy Information Administration by Alaska had fallen to fourth place in the nation in crude oil production after Texas North Dakota and California Prudhoe Bay on Alaska North Slope is still the second oil field in the United States typically producing about although by early North Dakota Bakken Formation was producing over Prudhoe Bay was the largest conventional oil field ever discovered in North America but was much smaller than Canada enormous Athabasca oil sands field which by was producing about of unconventional oil and had hundreds of years of producible reserves at that rate The Pipeline can transport and pump up to of crude oil per day more than any other crude oil pipeline in the United States Additionally substantial coal deposits are found in Alaska bituminous and lignite coal basins The United States Geological Survey estimates that there are of undiscovered technically recoverable gas from natural gas hydrates on the Alaskan North Slope Alaska also offers some of the highest hydroelectric power potential in the country from its numerous rivers Large swaths of the Alaskan coastline offer wind and geothermal energy potential as well Alaska economy depends heavily on increasingly expensive diesel fuel for heating transportation electric power and light Though wind and hydroelectric power are abundant and underdeveloped proposals for energy systems with special electric interties were judged uneconomical at the time of the report due to low less than gal fuel prices long distances and low population The cost of a gallon of gas in urban Alaska today is usually higher than the national average prices in rural areas are generally significantly higher but vary widely depending on transportation costs seasonal usage peaks nearby petroleum development infrastructure and many other factors Alaska was in domestically produced United States oil in February Permanent Fund The Alaska Permanent Fund is a constitutionally authorized appropriation of oil revenues established by voters in to manage a surplus in state petroleum revenues from oil largely in anticipation of the recently constructed Pipeline System The fund was originally proposed by Governor Keith Miller on the eve of the Prudhoe Bay lease sale out of fear that the legislature would spend the entire proceeds of the sale which amounted to million at once It was later championed by Governor Jay Hammond and Kenai state representative Hugh Malone It has served as an attractive political prospect ever since diverting revenues which would normally be deposited into the general fund The Alaska Constitution was written so as to discourage dedicating state funds for a particular purpose The Permanent Fund has become the rare exception to this mostly due to the political climate of distrust existing during the time of its creation From its initial principal of the fund has grown to billion as a result of oil royalties and capital investment programs Most if not all the principal is invested conservatively outside Alaska This has led to frequent calls by Alaskan politicians for the Fund to make investments within Alaska though such a stance has never gained momentum Starting in dividends from the fund annual growth have been paid out each year to eligible Alaskans ranging from an initial in equal to three years payout as the distribution of payments was held up in a lawsuit over the distribution scheme to in which included a Resource Rebate Every year the state legislature takes out from the earnings puts back into the principal for inflation proofing and the remaining is distributed to all qualifying Alaskans To qualify for the Permanent Fund Dividend one must have lived in the state for a minimum of months maintain constant residency subject to allowable absences and not be subject to court judgments or criminal convictions which fall under various disqualifying classifications or may subject the payment amount to civil garnishment Cost of living The cost of goods in Alaska has long been higher than in the contiguous states Federal government employees particularly United States Postal Service USPS workers and military members receive a Cost of Living Allowance usually set at of base pay because while the cost of living has gone down it is still one of the highest in the country Rural Alaska suffers from extremely high prices for food and consumer goods compared to the rest of the country due to the relatively limited transportation infrastructure Agriculture and fishing Due to the northern climate and short growing season relatively little farming occurs in Alaska Most farms are in either the Matanuska Valley about northeast of Anchorage or on the Kenai Peninsula about southwest of Anchorage The short growing season limits the crops that can be grown but the long sunny summer days make for productive growing seasons The primary crops are potatoes carrots lettuce and cabbage The Tanana Valley is another notable agricultural locus especially the Delta Junction area about southeast of Fairbanks with a sizable concentration of farms growing agronomic crops these farms mostly lie north and east of Fort Greely This area was largely set aside and developed under a state program spearheaded by Hammond during his second term as governor crops consist predominately of barley and hay West of Fairbanks lies another concentration of small farms catering to restaurants the hotel and tourist industry and agriculture Alaskan agriculture has experienced a surge in growth of market gardeners small farms and farmers markets in recent years with the highest percentage increase in the nation in growth in farmers markets in compared to nationwide The peony industry has also taken off as the growing season allows farmers to harvest during a gap in supply elsewhere in the world thereby filling a niche in the flower market Alaska with no counties lacks county fairs However a small assortment of state and local fairs with the Alaska State Fair in Palmer the largest are held mostly in the late summer The fairs are mostly located in communities with historic or current agricultural activity and feature local farmers exhibiting produce in addition to more commercial activities such as carnival rides concerts and food Alaska Grown is used as an agricultural slogan Alaska has an abundance of seafood with the primary fisheries in the Bering Sea and the North Pacific Seafood is one of the few food items that is often cheaper within the state than outside it Many Alaskans take advantage of salmon seasons to harvest portions of their household diet while fishing for subsistence as well as sport This includes fish taken by hook net or wheel Hunting for subsistence primarily caribou moose and Dall sheep is still common in the state particularly in remote Bush communities An example of a traditional native food is Akutaq the Eskimo ice cream which can consist of reindeer fat seal oil dried fish meat and local berries Alaska reindeer herding is concentrated on Seward Peninsula where wild caribou can be prevented from mingling and migrating with the domesticated reindeer Most food in Alaska is transported into the state from Outside and shipping costs make food in the cities relatively expensive In rural areas subsistence hunting and gathering is an essential activity because imported food is prohibitively expensive Though most small towns and villages in Alaska lie along the coastline the cost of importing food to remote villages can be high because of the terrain and difficult road conditions which change dramatically due to varying climate and precipitation changes The cost of transport can reach as high as per pound kg or more in some remote areas during the most difficult times if these locations can be reached at all during such inclement weather and terrain conditions The cost of delivering a of milk is about in many villages where per capita income can be or less Fuel cost per gallon is routinely higher than the continental United States average with only Hawaii having higher prices Transportation Roads Alaska has few road connections compared to the rest of the The state road system covers a relatively small area of the state linking the central population centers and the Alaska Highway the principal route out of the state through Canada The state capital Juneau is not accessible by road only a car ferry which has spurred several debates over the decades about moving the capital to a city on the road system or building a road connection from Haines The western part of Alaska has no road system connecting the communities with the rest of Alaska One unique feature of the Alaska Highway system is the Anton Anderson Memorial Tunnel an active Alaska Railroad tunnel recently upgraded to provide a paved roadway link with the isolated community of Whittier on Prince William Sound to the Seward Highway about southeast of Anchorage at Portage At the tunnel was the longest road tunnel in North America until The tunnel is the longest combination road and rail tunnel in North America Rail Built around the Alaska Railroad ARR played a key role in the development of Alaska through the century It links north Pacific shipping through providing critical infrastructure with tracks that run from Seward to Interior Alaska by way of South Central Alaska passing through Anchorage Eklutna Wasilla Talkeetna Denali and Fairbanks with spurs to Whittier Palmer and North Pole The cities towns villages and region served by ARR tracks are known statewide as The Railbelt In recent years the paved highway system began to eclipse the railroad importance in Alaska economy The railroad played a vital role in Alaska development moving freight into Alaska while transporting natural resources southward coal from the Usibelli coal mine near Healy to Seward and gravel from the Matanuska Valley to Anchorage It is well known for its summertime tour passenger service The Alaska Railroad was one of the last railroads in North America to use cabooses in regular service and still uses them on some gravel trains It continues to offer one of the last flag stop routes in the country A stretch of about of track along an area north of Talkeetna remains inaccessible by road the railroad provides the only transportation to rural homes and cabins in the area Until construction of the Parks Highway in the the railroad provided the only land access to most of the region along its entire route In northern Southeast Alaska the White Pass and Yukon Route also partly runs through the state from Skagway northwards into Canada British Columbia and Yukon Territory crossing the border at White Pass Summit This line is now mainly used by tourists often arriving by cruise liner at Skagway It was featured in the BBC television series Great Little Railways The Alaska Rail network is not connected to Outside In the Congress authorized million to study the feasibility of a rail link between Alaska Canada and the lower Alaska Rail Marine provides car float service between Whittier and Seattle Marine transport Many cities towns and villages in the state do not have road or highway access the only modes of access involve travel by air river or the sea Alaska ferry system known as the Alaska Marine Highway serves the cities of southeast the Gulf Coast and the Alaska Peninsula The ferries transport vehicles as well as passengers The system also operates a ferry service from Bellingham Washington and Prince Rupert British Columbia in Canada through the Inside Passage to Skagway The Ferry Authority also serves as an important marine link for many communities in the Prince of Wales Island region of Southeast and works in concert with the Alaska Marine Highway In recent years cruise lines have created a summertime tourism market mainly connecting the Pacific Northwest to Southeast Alaska and to a lesser degree towns along Alaska gulf coast The population of Ketchikan may rise by over people on many days during the summer as up to four large cruise ships at a time can dock debarking thousands of passengers Air transport Cities not served by road sea or river can be reached only by air foot dogsled or snowmachine accounting for Alaska extremely well developed bush air services an Alaskan novelty Anchorage and to a lesser extent Fairbanks is served by many major airlines Because of limited highway access air travel remains the most efficient form of transportation in and out of the state Anchorage recently completed extensive remodeling and construction at Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport to help accommodate the upsurge in tourism in Alaska received almost million visitors Regular flights to most villages and towns within the state that are commercially viable are challenging to provide so they are heavily subsidized by the federal government through the Essential Air Service program Alaska Airlines is the only major airline offering travel with jet service sometimes in combination cargo and passenger Boeing from Anchorage and Fairbanks to regional hubs like Bethel Nome Kotzebue Dillingham Kodiak and other larger communities as well as to major Southeast and Alaska Peninsula communities The bulk of remaining commercial flight offerings come from small regional commuter airlines such as Ravn Alaska PenAir and Frontier Flying Service The smallest towns and villages must rely on scheduled or chartered bush flying services using general aviation aircraft such as the Cessna Caravan the most popular aircraft in use in the state Much of this service can be attributed to the Alaska bypass mail program which subsidizes bulk mail delivery to Alaskan rural communities The program requires of that subsidy to go to carriers who offer passenger service to the communities Many communities have small air taxi services These operations originated from the demand for customized transport to remote areas Perhaps the most quintessentially Alaskan plane is the bush seaplane The world busiest seaplane base is Lake Hood located next to Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport where flights bound for remote villages without an airstrip carry passengers cargo and many items from stores and warehouse clubs In Alaska had the highest number of pilots per capita of any state Other transport Another Alaskan transportation method is the dogsled In modern times that is any time after the dog mushing is more of a sport than a true means of transportation Various races are held around the state but the best known is the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race a trail from Anchorage to Nome although the distance varies from year to year the official distance is set at The race commemorates the famous serum run to Nome in which mushers and dogs like Togo and Balto took medicine to the community of Nome when all other means of transportation had failed Mushers from all over the world come to Anchorage each March to compete for cash prizes and prestige The Serum Run is another sled dog race that more accurately follows the route of the famous relay leaving from the community of Nenana southwest of Fairbanks to Nome In areas not served by road or rail primary transportation in summer is by vehicle and in winter by snowmobile or snow machine as it is commonly referred to in Alaska Data transport Alaska internet and other data transport systems are provided largely through the two major telecommunications companies GCI and Alaska Communications GCI owns and operates what it calls the Alaska United Fiber Optic system and as of late Alaska Communications advertised that it has two fiber optic paths to the lower and two more across Alaska In January it was reported that a billion project to run connect Asia and rural Alaska was being planned aided in part by million in stimulus from the federal government Law and government State government Like all other states Alaska is governed as a republic with three branches of government an executive branch consisting of the Governor of Alaska and the other independently elected constitutional officers a legislative branch consisting of the Alaska House of Representatives and Alaska Senate and a judicial branch consisting of the Alaska Supreme Court and lower courts The state of Alaska employs approximately people statewide The Alaska Legislature consists of a House of Representatives and a Senate Senators serve terms and House members two The Governor of Alaska serves terms The lieutenant governor runs separately from the governor in the primaries but during the general election the nominee for governor and nominee for lieutenant governor run together on the same ticket Alaska court system has four levels the Alaska Supreme Court the Alaska Court of Appeals the superior courts and the district courts The superior and district courts are trial courts Superior courts are courts of general jurisdiction while district courts only hear certain types of cases including misdemeanor criminal cases and civil cases valued up to The Supreme Court and the Court of Appeals are appellate courts The Court of Appeals is required to hear appeals from certain decisions including those regarding criminal prosecutions juvenile delinquency and habeas corpus The Supreme Court hears civil appeals and may in its discretion hear criminal appeals State politics Although in its early years of statehood Alaska was a Democratic state since the early it has been characterized as Local political communities have often worked on issues related to land use development fishing tourism and individual rights Alaska Natives while organized in and around their communities have been active within the Native corporations These have been given ownership over large tracts of land which require stewardship Alaska was formerly the only state in which possession of one ounce or less of marijuana in one home was completely legal under state law though the federal law remains in force The state has an independence movement favoring a vote on secession from the United States with the Alaskan Independence Party Six Republicans and four Democrats have served as governor of Alaska In addition Republican Governor Wally Hickel was elected to the office for a second term in after leaving the Republican party and briefly joining the Alaskan Independence Party ticket just long enough to be reelected He subsequently officially rejoined the Republican party in Taxes To finance state government operations Alaska depends primarily on petroleum revenues and federal subsidies This allows it to have the lowest individual tax burden in the United States It is one of five states with no state sales tax one of seven states that do not levy an individual income tax and one of the two states that has neither The Department of Revenue Tax Division reports regularly on the state revenue sources The Department also issues an annual summary of its operations including new state laws that directly affect the tax division While Alaska has no state sales tax municipalities collect a local sales tax from typically Other local taxes levied include raw fish taxes hotel motel and bed taxes severance taxes liquor and tobacco taxes gaming pull tabs taxes tire taxes and fuel transfer taxes A part of the revenue collected from certain state taxes and license fees such as petroleum aviation motor fuel telephone cooperative is shared with municipalities in Alaska Fairbanks has one of the highest property taxes in the state as no sales or income taxes are assessed in the Fairbanks North Star Borough FNSB A sales tax for the FNSB has been voted on many times but has yet to be approved leading law makers to increase taxes dramatically on goods such as liquor and tobacco In the Tax Foundation ranked Alaska as having the fourth most business friendly tax policy behind only Wyoming South Dakota and Nevada Federal politics Alaska regularly supports Republicans in presidential elections and has done so since statehood Republicans have won the state electoral college votes in all but one election that it has participated in No state has voted for a Democratic presidential candidate fewer times Alaska was carried by Democratic nominee Lyndon Johnson during his landslide election in while the and elections were close Since however Republicans have carried the state by large margins In Republican John McCain defeated Democrat Barack Obama in Alaska to McCain running mate was Sarah Palin the state governor and the first Alaskan on a major party ticket Obama lost Alaska again in but he captured of the state vote in that election making him the first Democrat to do so since The Alaska Bush central Juneau midtown and downtown Anchorage and the areas surrounding the University of Alaska Fairbanks campus and Ester have been strongholds of the Democratic Party The Borough the majority of Fairbanks including North Pole and the military base and South Anchorage
