Alabama Alabama is a state located in the southeastern region of the United States It is bordered by Tennessee to the north Georgia to the east Florida and the Gulf of Mexico to the south and Mississippi to the west Alabama is the extensive and the populous of the United States At Alabama has one of the longest navigable inland waterways in the nation From the American Civil War until World War II Alabama like many Southern states suffered economic hardship in part because of continued dependence on agriculture Despite the growth of major industries and urban centers White rural interests dominated the state legislature from to the as it did not regularly reapportion the legislature from to urban interests and African Americans were markedly African Americans and poor whites were essentially disenfranchised altogether by the state constitution of a status that continued into the before being alleviated by federal legislation Following World War II Alabama experienced growth as the economy of the state transitioned from one primarily based on agriculture to one with diversified interests The power of the Solid South in Congress gained the establishment or expansion of multiple United States Armed Forces installations which helped to bridge the gap between an agricultural and industrial economy during the century The state economy in the century is based on management automotive finance manufacturing aerospace mineral extraction healthcare education retail and technology Alabama is nicknamed the Yellowhammer State after the state bird Alabama is also known as the Heart of Dixie and the Cotton State The state tree is the Longleaf Pine and the state flower is the Camellia The capital of Alabama is Montgomery The largest city by population is Birmingham which has long been the most industrialized city and largest city by total land area is Huntsville The oldest city is Mobile founded by French colonists Etymology The naming of the Alabama River and state originates from the Alabama people a tribe whose members lived just below the confluence of the Coosa and Tallapoosa rivers on the upper reaches of the river In the Alabama language the word for an Alabama person is Albaamo or variously Albaama or Alb amo in different dialects the plural form is Albaamaha The word Alabama is believed to have come from the related Choctaw language and was adopted by the Alabama tribe as their name The spelling of the word varies significantly among historical sources The first usage appears in three accounts of the Hernando de Soto expedition of with Garcilaso de la Vega using Alibamo while the Knight of Elvas and Rodrigo Ranjel wrote Alibamu and Limamu respectively in efforts to transliterate the term As early as the French called the tribe the Alibamon with French maps identifying the river as Rivi re des Alibamons Other spellings of the appellation have included Alibamu Alabamo Albama Alebamon Alibama Alibamou Alabamu Allibamou Sources disagree on the meaning of the word An article in the Jacksonville Republican proposed that it meant Here We Rest This notion was popularized in the through the writings of Alexander Beaufort Meek Experts in the Muskogean languages have been unable to find any evidence to support such a translation Scholars believe the word comes from the Choctaw alba meaning plants or weeds and amo meaning to cut to trim or to gather The meaning may have been clearers of the thicket or herb gatherers referring to clearing land for cultivation or collecting medicinal plants The state has numerous place names of Native American origin History settlement Indigenous peoples of varying cultures lived in the area for thousands of years before European colonization Trade with the northeastern tribes via the Ohio River began during the Burial Mound Period BC AD and continued until European contact The agrarian Mississippian culture covered most of the state from to AD with one of its major centers built at what is now the Moundville Archaeological Site in Moundville Alabama This is the complex of of the classic Middle Mississippian era after Cahokia in Illinois which was the center of the culture Analysis of artifacts recovered from archaeological excavations at Moundville were the basis of scholars formulating the characteristics of the Southeastern Ceremonial Complex SECC Contrary to popular belief the SECC appears to have no direct links to Mesoamerican culture but developed independently The Ceremonial Complex represents a major component of the religion of the Mississippian peoples it is one of the primary means by which their religion is understood Among the historical tribes of Native American people living in the area of Alabama at the time of European contact were the Cherokee an Iroquoian language people and the Alabama Alibamu Chickasaw Choctaw Creek and Koasati While part of the same large language family the Muskogee tribes developed distinct cultures and languages European settlement With exploration in the century the Spanish were the first Europeans to reach Alabama The expedition of Hernando de Soto passed through Mabila and other parts of the state in More than years later the French founded the first European settlement in the region at Old Mobile in The city was moved to the current site of Mobile in This area was claimed by the French from to as part of La Louisiane After the French lost to the British in the Seven Years War it became part of British West Florida from to After the United States victory in the American Revolutionary War the territory was divided between the United States and Spain The latter retained control of this western territory from until the surrender of the Spanish garrison at Mobile to forces on April Thomas Bassett a loyalist to the British monarchy during the Revolutionary era was one of the earliest White settlers in the state outside Mobile He settled in the Tombigbee District during the early The boundaries of the district were roughly limited to the area within a few miles of the Tombigbee River and included portions of what is today southern Clarke County northernmost Mobile County and most of Washington County What is now the counties of Baldwin and Mobile became part of Spanish West Florida in part of the independent Republic of West Florida in and was finally added to the Mississippi Territory in Most of what is now the northern of Alabama was known as the Yazoo lands beginning during the British colonial period It was claimed by the Province of Georgia from onwards Following the Revolutionary War it remained a part of Georgia although heavily disputed With the exception of the area around Mobile and the Yazoo lands what is now the lower Alabama was made part of the Mississippi Territory when it was organized in The Yazoo lands were added to the territory in following the Yazoo land scandal Spain kept a claim on its former Spanish West Florida territory in what would become the coastal counties until the Adams On s Treaty officially ceded it to the United States in century Prior to the admission of Mississippi as a state on December the more sparsely settled eastern half of the territory was separated and named the Alabama Territory The Alabama Territory was created by the United States Congress on March Stephens now abandoned served as the territorial capital from to The Congress selected Huntsville as the site for the first Constitutional Convention of Alabama after it was approved to become the state From July to August delegates met to prepare the new state constitution Huntsville served as the temporary capital of Alabama from to when the seat of state government was moved to Cahaba in Dallas County Cahaba now a ghost town was the first permanent state capital from to Alabama Fever was already underway when the state was admitted to the Union with settlers and land speculators pouring into the state to take advantage of fertile land suitable for cotton cultivation Part of the frontier in the and its constitution provided for universal suffrage for white men Southeastern planters and traders from the Upper South brought slaves with them as the cotton plantations in Alabama expanded The economy of the central Black Belt named for its dark productive soil was built around large cotton plantations whose owners wealth grew largely from slave labor The area also drew many poor disfranchised people who became subsistence farmers Alabama had a population estimated at under people in but it had increased to more than people by Most Native American tribes were completely removed from the state within a few years of the passage of the Indian Removal Act by Congress in From to Tuscaloosa served as the capital of Alabama On January the Alabama legislature announced that it had voted to move the capital city from Tuscaloosa to Montgomery The first legislative session in the new capital met in December A new capitol building was erected under the direction of Stephen Decatur Button of Philadelphia The first structure burned down in but was rebuilt on the same site in This second capitol building in Montgomery remains to the present day It was designed by Barachias Holt of Exeter Maine By the population had increased to a total of people of which nearly half were enslaved African Americans and were free people of color On January Alabama declared its secession from the Union After remaining an independent republic for a few days it joined the Confederate States of America The Confederacy capital was initially located at Montgomery Alabama was heavily involved in the American Civil War Although comparatively few battles were fought in the state Alabama contributed about soldiers to the war effort A company of cavalry soldiers from Huntsville Alabama joined Nathan Bedford Forrest battalion in Hopkinsville Kentucky The company wore new uniforms with yellow trim on the sleeves collar and coat tails This led to them being greeted with Yellowhammer and the name later was applied to all Alabama troops in the Confederate Army Alabama slaves were freed by the Amendment in Alabama was under military rule from the end of the war in May until its official restoration to the Union in From to with most White citizens barred temporarily from voting and freedmen enfranchised many African Americans emerged as political leaders in the state Alabama was represented in Congress during this period by three congressmen Jeremiah Haralson Benjamin Turner and James Rapier Following the war the state remained chiefly agricultural with an economy tied to cotton During Reconstruction state legislators ratified a new state constitution in that created the state first public school system and expanded women rights Legislators funded numerous public road and railroad projects although these were plagued with allegations of fraud and misappropriation Organized insurgent resistance groups tried to suppress the freedmen and Republicans Besides the original Ku Klux Klan these included the Pale Faces Knights of the White Camellia Red Shirts and the White League Reconstruction in Alabama ended in when the Democrats regained control of the legislature and governor office through an election dominated by fraud and violence They wrote another constitution in and the legislature passed the Blaine Amendment prohibiting public money from being used to finance schools The same year legislation was approved that called for racially segregated schools Railroad passenger cars were segregated in After disfranchising most African Americans and many poor whites in the constitution the Alabama legislature passed more Jim Crow laws at the beginning of the century to impose segregation in everyday life century The new Constitution of Alabama included provisions for voter registration that effectively disenfranchised large portions of the population including nearly all African Americans and Native Americans and tens of thousands of poor whites through making voter registration difficult requiring a poll taxes and literacy test By only African Americans were registered in Alabama although at least were literate This compared to more than African Americans eligible to vote in The numbers dropped even more in later decades While the planter class had persuaded poor Whites to vote for this legislative effort to suppress black voting the new restrictions resulted in their disenfranchisement as well due mostly to the imposition of a cumulative poll tax By whites constituted a slight majority of those disenfranchised by these laws Whites Nearly all African Americans had lost the ability to vote Despite numerous legal challenges that succeeded in overturning certain provisions the state legislature would create new ones to maintain disenfranchisement The exclusion of blacks from the political system persisted until after passage of federal civil rights legislation in the to enforce their constitutional rights as citizens The constitution required racial segregation of public schools It also restated that interracial marriage was illegal as it had been prohibited in Into the the state legislature passed additional racial segregation laws related to public facilities jails were segregated in hospitals in toilets hotels and restaurants in and bus stop waiting rooms in The Alabama legislature consistently underfunded schools and services for the disenfranchised African Americans but it did not relieve them of paying taxes Partially as a response to chronic underfunding of education for African Americans in the South the Rosenwald Fund began funding the construction of what came to be known as Rosenwald Schools In Alabama these schools were designed and the construction partially financed with Rosenwald funds which paid of the construction costs The fund required the local community and state to raise matching funds to pay the rest Black residents effectively taxed themselves twice by raising additional monies to supply matching funds for such schools which were built in many rural areas They often donated land and labor as well Beginning in the first Rosenwald Schools were built in Alabama for children A total of schools seven teachers houses and several vocational buildings were completed by in the state Several of the surviving school buildings in the state are now listed on the National Register of Historic Places Continued racial discrimination and lynchings agricultural depression and the failure of the cotton crops due to boll weevil infestation led tens of thousands of African Americans from rural Alabama and other states to seek opportunities in northern and midwestern cities during the early decades of the century as part of the Great Migration out of the South Reflecting this emigration the population growth rate in Alabama see Historical Populations table below dropped by nearly half from to At the same time many rural people both White and African American migrated to the city of Birmingham to work in new industrial jobs Birmingham experienced such rapid growth that it was called The Magic City By the Birmingham was the city in the United States and had more than of the state population Heavy industry and mining were the basis of its economy Its residents were for decades in the state legislature which refused to redistrict after each decennial census according to population changes as it was required by the state constitution This did not change until the late following a lawsuit and court order to establish the principle of apportionment as one man one vote Beginning in the when the courts started taking the first steps to recognize the voting rights of black voters the Alabama legislature took several counter steps designed to disfranchise black voters The legislature passed and the voters ratified these were mostly white voters a state constitutional amendment that gave local registrars greater latitude to disqualify voter registration applicants Black citizens in Mobile successfully challenged this amendment as a violation of the Fifteenth Amendment The legislature also changed the boundaries of Tuskegee to a figure designed to fence out blacks from the city limits The Supreme Court unanimously held that this racial gerrymandering violated the Constitution In the Alabama legislature also intentionally diluted the effect of the black vote by instituting numbered place requirements for local elections Industrial development related to the demands of World War II brought a level of prosperity to the state not seen since before the Civil War Rural workers poured into the largest cities in the state for better jobs and a higher standard of living One example of this massive influx of workers occurred in Mobile Between and more than people moved into the city to work for industries Cotton and other cash crops faded in importance as the state developed a manufacturing and service base Despite massive population changes in the state from to the legislature refused to reapportion House and Senate seats based on population as required by the state constitution to follow the results of decennial censuses They held on to old representation to maintain political and economic power in agricultural areas In addition the state legislature gerrymandered the few Birmingham legislative seats to ensure election by persons living outside Birmingham One result was that Jefferson County containing Birmingham industrial and economic powerhouse contributed more than of all tax revenue to the state but did not receive a proportional amount in services Urban interests were consistently underrepresented in the legislature A study noted that because of rural domination a minority of about per cent of the total state population is in majority control of the Alabama legislature A class action suit initiated on behalf of plaintiffs in Lowndes County Alabama challenged the state legislature lack of redistricting for congressional seats In White Crook Judge Frank Johnson ordered the state to redistrict United States Supreme Court cases of Baker Carr and Reynolds Sims ruled that the principle of one man one vote needed to be the basis of both houses of state legislatures as well and that their districts had to be based on population rather than geographic counties as Alabama had used for its senate In for the first time since the legislature completed the first congressional redistricting based on the decennial census This benefited the urban areas that had developed as well as all in the population who had been underrepresented for more than years Other changes were made to implement representative state house and senate districts African Americans continued to press in the and to end disenfranchisement and segregation in the state through the Civil Rights Movement including legal challenges In the US Supreme Court ruled in Brown Board of Education that public schools had to be desegregated but Alabama was slow to comply During the under Governor George Wallace Alabama resisted compliance with federal demands for civil rights movement had notable events in Alabama including the Montgomery Bus Boycott Freedom Rides in and Selma to Montgomery marches These contributed to Congressional passage and enactment of the Civil Rights Act of and Voting Rights Act of by the Congress Legal segregation ended in the states in but Jim Crow customs often continued until specifically challenged in court Despite recommendations of a Alabama Constitutional Commission the state legislature did not approve an amendment to establish home rule for counties There is very limited home rule but the legislature is deeply involved in passing legislation that applies to functions and policies This both deprives local residents of the ability to govern themselves and distracts the legislature from statewide issues Alabama has made some changes since the late century and has used new types of voting to increase representation In the an omnibus redistricting case Dillard Crenshaw County challenged the voting for representative seats of Alabama jurisdictions including counties and school boards voting had diluted the votes of any minority in a county as the majority tended to take all seats Despite African Americans making up a significant minority in the state they had been unable to elect any representatives in most of the jurisdictions As part of settlement of this case five Alabama cites and counties including Chilton County adopted a system of cumulative voting for election of representatives in jurisdictions This has resulted in more proportional representation for voters In another form of proportional representation jurisdictions use limited voting as in Conecuh County In limited voting was first tested in Conecuh County Together use of these systems has increased the number of African Americans and women being elected to local offices resulting in governments that are more representative of their citizens Geography Alabama is the state in the United

Wetumpka crater the site of Alabama greatest natural disaster A wide meteorite hit the area about million years ago The hills just east of downtown Wetumpka showcase the eroded remains of the impact crater that was blasted into the bedrock with the area labeled the Wetumpka crater or astrobleme because of the concentric rings of fractures and zones of shattered rock that can be found beneath the

largest immigrant group from the British Isles before the American Revolution and many settled in the South later moving into the Deep South as it was developed In under the Davis Strong Act the state legislature established the Alabama Indian Affairs Commission Native American groups within the state had increasingly been demanding recognition as ethnic groups and seeking an end to discrimination Given the long history of slavery and associated racial segregation the Native American peoples who have sometimes been of mixed race have insisted on having their cultural identification respected In the past their was often overlooked as the state tried to impose a binary breakdown of society into white and black The state has officially recognized nine American Indian tribes in the state

ratified in At almost amendments and words it is by some accounts the world longest constitution and is roughly forty times the length of the United States Constitution There has been a significant movement to rewrite and modernize Alabama constitution Critics suggest that Alabama constitution highly centralizes power in Montgomery and leaves practically no power in local hands Most counties do not have home rule Any policy changes proposed around the state must be approved by the entire Alabama legislature and frequently by state referendum One criticism of the current constitution claims that its complexity and length intentionally codify segregation and racism Alabama government is divided into three coequal branches The legislative branch is the Alabama Legislature a bicameral assembly composed of the Alabama House of Representatives with members and the Alabama Senate with members The Legislature is responsible for writing debating passing or defeating state legislation The Republican Party currently holds a majority in both houses of the Legislature The Legislature has the power to override a gubernatorial veto by a simple majority most state Legislatures require a majority to override a veto Until the state elected state senators by county with one per county It had not redistricted congressional districts since passage of its constitution in as a result urbanized areas were grossly underrepresented It had not changed legislative districts to reflect the decennial censuses either In Reynolds Sims the US Supreme Court implemented the principle of one man one vote ruling that congressional districts had to be reapportioned based on censuses as the state already had in its constitution but had not implemented Further it ruled that both houses of bicameral state legislatures had to be apportioned by population as there was no constitutional basis for states to have geographically based systems At that time Alabama and many other states had to change their legislative districting as many across the country had systems that underrepresented urban areas and districts This had caused decades of underinvestment in such areas For instance Birmingham and Jefferson County taxes had supplied of the state budget but Jefferson County received only of state services in funding Through the legislative delegations the Alabama legislature kept

limited executive authority in the county Because of the restraints placed in the Alabama Constitution all but seven counties Jefferson Lee Mobile Madison Montgomery Shelby and Tuscaloosa in the state have little to no home rule Instead most counties in the state must lobby the Local Legislation Committee of the state legislature to get simple local policies approved even waste disposal to land use zoning The cumbersome process results in local jurisdictions being unable to manage their problems and the state legislature is buried in local county issues The state legislature has retained power over local governments by refusing to pass a constitutional amendment establishing home rule for counties as recommended by the Alabama Constitutional Commission Legislative delegations retain certain powers over each county although changes resulted from United States Supreme Court decisions in the requiring the establishment of districts to implement the principle of one man one vote The lack of home rule for counties in Alabama has resulted in the proliferation of local legislation permitting counties to do things not authorized by the state constitution Alabama constitution has been amended more than times and almost of the amendments are local in nature applying to only one county or city A significant part of each legislative session is spent on local legislation taking away time and attention of legislators from issues of statewide importance On November Jefferson County which was billion in debt at the time declared bankruptcy This is the Chapter municipal bankruptcy in the

sales Politics During Reconstruction following the American Civil War Alabama was occupied by federal troops of the Third Military District under General John Pope In the political coalition known as the Redeemers took control of the state government from the Republicans in part by suppressing the vote through violence fraud and intimidation After a coalition of White politicians passed laws to segregate and disenfranchise African American residents a process completed in provisions of the constitution Provisions which disenfranchised African Americans also excluded many poor Whites By more Whites than African Americans had been disenfranchised to although the impact was greater on the community as almost all of its citizens were disfranchised and relegated to separate and unequal treatment under the law From through the the state did not redraw election districts as population grew and shifted within the state The result was a rural minority that dominated state politics until a series of court cases required redistricting in Alabama state politics gained nationwide and international attention in the and during the American Civil Rights Movement when racist Whites bureaucratically and at times violently resisted protests for electoral and social reform Democrat George Wallace the state only governor was a controversial figure Only with the passage of the Federal Civil Rights Act of and Voting Rights Act of did African Americans regain the ability to exercise suffrage among other civil rights In the Alabama Legislature passed and Republican Governor Bob Riley signed a resolution expressing profound regret over slavery and its lingering impact In a symbolic ceremony the bill was signed in the Alabama State Capitol which housed Congress of the Confederate States of America In Republicans won control of both houses of the legislature for the first time in years after a nearly complete realignment of political parties The party is dominated by white conservatives who used to belong to the Democratic Party Elections State elections With the disfranchisement of African Americans in the state became part of the Solid South a system in which the Democratic Party operated as effectively the only viable political party in every Southern state For nearly years local and state elections in Alabama were decided in the Democratic Party primary with generally only token Republican challengers running in the General Election Since the mid to century however there has been a realignment among the two major political parties and white conservatives started shifting to the Republican Party In Alabama districts are now expected to regularly elect Republican candidates to federal state and local office Members of the nine seats on the Alabama Supreme Court and all ten seats on the state appellate courts are elected to office Until no Republicans held any of the court seats In that general election the Chief Justice of Alabama Ernest Hornsby refused to leave office after losing the election by approximately votes to Republican Perry Hooper Hornsby sued Alabama and defiantly remained in office for nearly a year before finally giving up the seat after losing in court This ultimately led to a collapse of support for Democrats at the ballot box in the next three or four election cycles The Democrats lost the last of the nineteen court seats in August with the resignation of the last Democrat on the bench In the early century Republicans hold all seven of the statewide elected executive branch offices Republicans hold six of the eight elected seats on the Alabama State Board of Education In Republicans took large majorities of both chambers of the state legislature giving them control of that body for the first time in years Democrats hold one of the three seats on the Alabama Public Service Commission Only two Republican Lieutenant Governors have been elected since the end of Reconstruction when Republicans generally represented Reconstruction government including the newly emancipated freedmen who had gained the franchise One is Kay Ivey a current Republican and the current Lieutenant Governor Local elections Many local offices County Commissioners Boards of Education Tax Assessors Tax Collectors in the state are still held by Democrats Many rural counties have voters who are majority Democrats resulting in many local elections being decided in the Democratic primary Similarly many metropolitan and suburban counties are and elections are effectively decided in the Republican Primary although there are exceptions Alabama County Sheriffs are elected in partisan races and Democrats still retain the majority of those posts The current split is Democrats Republicans and one Independent Choctaw However most of the Democratic sheriffs preside over rural and less populated counties The majority of Republican sheriffs have been elected in the more and heavily populated counties Two Alabama counties Montgomery and Calhoun with a population of over have Democratic sheriffs and five Alabama counties with a population of under have Republican sheriffs Autauga
