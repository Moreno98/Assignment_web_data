Animal Farm Animal Farm is an allegorical and dystopian novella by George Orwell first published in England on August According to Orwell the book reflects events leading up to the Russian Revolution of and then on into the Stalin era in the Soviet Union Orwell a democratic socialist was a critic of Joseph Stalin and hostile to Stalinism an attitude that was critically shaped by his experiences during the Spanish Civil War The Soviet Union he believed had become a brutal dictatorship built upon a cult of personality and enforced by a reign of terror In a letter to Yvonne Davet Orwell described Animal Farm as a satirical tale against Stalin un conte satirique contre Staline and in his essay Why I Write he wrote that Animal Farm was the first book in which he had tried with full consciousness of what he was doing to fuse political purpose and artistic purpose into one whole The original title was Animal Farm A Fairy Story though the subtitle was dropped by publishers for its publication and subsequently all but one of the translations during Orwell lifetime omitted it Other variations in the title include A Satire and A Contemporary Satire Orwell suggested the title Union des r publiques socialistes animales for the French translation which abbreviates to URSA the Latin for bear a symbol of Russia and which recalled the French name of the Soviet Union Union des r publiques socialistes sovi tiques Orwell wrote the book from November to February when the wartime alliance with the Soviet Union was at its height and Stalin was regarded highly by the British people and intelligentsia a circumstance that Orwell hated It was initially rejected by a number of British and American publishers including one of Orwell own Victor Gollancz Its publication was thus delayed though it became a great commercial success when it did finally appear partly because the Cold War so quickly followed World War II Time magazine chose the book as one of the best novels to it also featured at number on the Modern Library List of Best Novels It won a Retrospective Hugo Award in and is also included in the Great Books of the Western World selection Plot summary Old Major the old boar on the Manor Farm summons the animals on the farm together for a meeting during which he refers to humans as parasites and teaches the animals a revolutionary song called Beasts of England When Major dies two young pigs Snowball and Napoleon assume command and consider it a duty to prepare for the Rebellion The animals revolt and drive the drunken and irresponsible farmer Jones from the farm renaming it Animal Farm They adopt Seven Commandments of Animalism the most important of which is All animals are equal Snowball teaches the animals to read and write while Napoleon educates young puppies on the principles of Animalism Food is plentiful and the farm runs smoothly The pigs elevate themselves to positions of leadership and set aside special food items ostensibly for their personal health Napoleon and Snowball struggle for preeminence When Snowball announces his plans to build a windmill Napoleon has his dogs chase Snowball away and subsequently declares himself leader of Animal Farm Napoleon enacts changes to the governance structure of the farm replacing meetings with a committee of pigs who will run the farm Through a young pig named Squealer Napoleon claims credit for the windmill idea The animals work harder with the promise of easier lives with the windmill When the animals find the windmill collapsed after a violent storm Napoleon and Squealer convince the animals that Snowball is trying to sabotage their project Once Snowball becomes a scapegoat Napoleon begins to purge the farm with his dogs killing animals he accuses of consorting with his old rival Beasts of England is replaced by an anthem glorifying Napoleon who appears to be adopting the lifestyle of a man The animals remain convinced that they are better off than they were under Jones Mr Frederick one of the neighbouring farmers attacks the farm using blasting powder to blow up the restored windmill Though the animals win the battle they do so at great cost as many including Boxer the workhorse are wounded Despite his injuries Boxer continues working harder and harder until he collapses while working on the windmill Napoleon sends for a van to take Boxer to the veterinary surgeon explaining that better care can be given there Benjamin the cynical donkey who could read as well as any pig notices that the van belongs to a knacker and attempts a futile rescue Squealer reports that the van was purchased by the hospital and the writing from the previous owner had not been repainted But in reality Napoleon has sold his most loyal and worker for money to buy himself whisky Years pass and the pigs start to resemble humans as they walk upright carry whips and wear clothes The Seven Commandments are abridged to a single phrase All animals are equal but some animals are more equal than others Napoleon holds a dinner party for the pigs and local farmers with whom he celebrates a new alliance He abolishes the practice of the revolutionary traditions and restores the name The Manor Farm As the animals look from pigs to humans they realise they can no longer distinguish between the two Composition and publication Origin George Orwell wrote the manuscript in and subsequent to his experiences during the Spanish Civil War which he described in Homage to Catalonia In the preface of a Ukrainian edition of Animal Farm he explained how escaping the communist purges in Spain taught him how easily totalitarian propaganda can control the opinion of enlightened people in democratic countries This motivated Orwell to expose and strongly condemn what he saw as the Stalinist corruption of the original socialist ideals Immediately prior to his writing Orwell had quit the BBC He was also upset about a booklet for propagandists the Ministry of Information had put out The booklet included instructions on how to quell ideological fears of the Soviet Union such as directions to claim that the Red Terror was a figment of Nazi imagination In the preface Orwell also described the source of the idea of setting the book on a farm Efforts to find a publisher Orwell initially encountered difficulty getting the manuscript published largely due to fears that the book might upset the alliance between the US UK and the Soviet Union Four publishers refused one had initially accepted the work but declined after consulting the Ministry of Information Eventually Secker and Warburg published the first edition in During World War II it became apparent to Orwell that literature was not something which most major publishing houses would touch including his regular publisher Gollancz He also submitted the manuscript to Faber and Faber where the poet Eliot who was a director of the firm rejected it Eliot wrote back to Orwell praising its good writing and fundamental integrity but declared that they would only accept it for publication if they had some sympathy for the viewpoint which I take to be generally Trotskyite Eliot said he found the view not convincing and contended that the pigs were made out to be the best to run the farm he posited that someone might argue what was needed was not more communism but more pigs Orwell let Andr Deutsch who was working for Nicholson Watson in read the typescript and Deutsch was convinced that Nicholson Watson would want to publish it however they did not and lectured Orwell on what they perceived to be errors in Animal Farm In his London Letter on April for Partisan Review Orwell wrote that it was now next door to impossible to get anything overtly printed books do appear but mostly from Catholic publishing firms and always from a religious or frankly reactionary angle The publisher Jonathan Cape who had initially accepted Animal Farm subsequently rejected the book after an official at the British Ministry of Information warned him off although the civil servant who it is assumed gave the order was later found to be a Soviet spy Writing to Leonard Moore a partner in the literary agency of Christy Moore publisher Jonathan Cape explained that the decision had been taken on the advice of a senior official in the Ministry of Information Such flagrant bias was unacceptable and the choice of pigs as the dominant class was thought to be especially offensive It may reasonably be assumed that the important official was a man named Peter Smollett who was later unmasked as a Soviet agent Orwell was suspicious of and he would be one of the names Orwell included in his list of and sent to the Information Research Department in Born Hans Peter Smolka in Vienna in he came to Britain in as an NKVD agent with the codename Abo became a naturalised British subject in changed his name and after the outbreak of World War II joined the Ministry of Information where he organised propaganda working with Kim Philby in Smollett family have rejected the accusation that he was a spy The publisher wrote to Orwell saying Frederic Warburg also faced pressures against publication even from people in his own office and from his wife Pamela who felt that it was not the moment for ingratitude towards Stalin and the heroic Red Army which had played a major part in defeating Hitler A Russian translation was printed in the paper Posev and in giving permission for a Russian translation of Animal Farm Orwell refused in advance all royalties A translation in Ukrainian which was produced in Germany was confiscated in large part by the American wartime authorities and handed over to the Soviet repatriation commission In October Orwell wrote to Frederic Warburg expressing interest in pursuing the possibility that the political cartoonist David Low might illustrate Animal Farm Low had written a letter saying that he had had a good time with ANIMAL FARM an excellent bit of satire it would illustrate perfectly Nothing came of this and a trial issue produced by Secker Warburg in illustrated by John Driver was abandoned but the Folio Society published an edition in illustrated by Quentin Blake and an edition illustrated by the cartoonist Ralph Steadman was published by Secker Warburg in to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the first edition of Animal Farm The Freedom of the Press Orwell originally wrote a preface complaining about British and how the British people were suppressing criticism of the USSR their World War II ally The sinister fact about literary censorship in England is that it is largely voluntary Things are kept right out of the British press not because the Government intervenes but because of a general tacit agreement that it would do to mention that particular fact Although the first edition allowed space for the preface it was not included and as of June it has not been published with most editions of the book Secker and Warburg published the first edition of Animal Farm in without any introduction However the publisher had provided space for a preface in the author proof composited from the manuscript For reasons unknown no preface was supplied and all the page numbers needed to be redone at the last minute Years later in Ian Angus found the original typescript titled The Freedom of the Press and Bernard Crick published it together with his own introduction in The Times Literary Supplement on September as How the essay came to be written Orwell essay criticised British by the press specifically the suppression of unflattering descriptions of Stalin and the Soviet government The same essay also appeared in the Italian Animal Farm edition with another introduction by Crick claiming to be the first edition with the preface Other publishers were still declining to publish it Critical response Contemporary reviews of the work were not universally positive Writing in the American New Republic magazine George Soule expressed his disappointment in the book writing that it puzzled and saddened me It seemed on the whole dull The allegory turned out to be a creaking machine for saying in a clumsy way things that have been said better directly Soule believed that the animals were not consistent enough with their real world inspirations and said It seems to me that the failure of this book commercially it is already assured of tremendous success arises from the fact that the satire deals not with something the author has experienced but rather with stereotyped ideas about a country which he probably does not know very well Tosco Fyvel writing in Tribune August called the book a gentle satire on a certain State and on the illusions of an age which may already be behind us Julian Symons responded on September Should we not expect in Tribune at least acknowledgement of the fact that it is a satire not at all gentle upon a particular State Soviet Russia It seems to me that a reviewer should have the courage to identify Napoleon with Stalin and Snowball with Trotsky and express an opinion favourable or unfavourable to the author upon a political ground In a hundred years time perhaps Animal Farm may be simply a fairy story today it is a political satire with a good deal of point Animal Farm has been subject to much comment in the decades since these early remarks Analysis Animalism The pigs Snowball Napoleon and Squealer adapt Old Major ideas into a complete system of thought which they formally name Animalism an allegoric reference to Communism Soon after Napoleon and Squealer partake in activities associated with the humans drinking alcohol sleeping in beds trading which were explicitly prohibited by the Seven Commandments Squealer is employed to alter the Seven Commandments to account for this humanisation an allusion to the Soviet government revising of history in order to exercise control of the people beliefs about themselves and their society The original commandments are Later Napoleon and his pigs secretly revise some commandments to clear themselves of accusations of The changed commandments are as follows with the changes bolded Eventually these are replaced with the maxims All animals are equal but some animals are more equal than others and Four legs good two legs better as the pigs become more human This is an ironic twist to the original purpose of the Seven Commandments which were supposed to keep order within Animal Farm by uniting the animals together against the humans and preventing animals from following the humans evil habits Through the revision of the commandments Orwell demonstrates how simply political dogma can be turned into malleable propaganda Significance and allegory In the Eastern Bloc both Animal Farm and later Nineteen were on the list of forbidden books until the end of communism in and were only available via clandestine Samizdat networks Orwell biographer Jeffrey Meyers has written virtually every detail has political significance in this allegory Orwell himself wrote in Of course I intended it primarily as a satire on the Russian revolution that kind of revolution violent conspiratorial revolution led by unconsciously power hungry people can only lead to a change of masters revolutions only effect a radical improvement when the masses are alert In a preface for a Ukrainian edition he stated for the past ten years I have been convinced that the destruction of the Soviet myth was essential if we wanted a revival of the socialist movement On my return from Spain I thought of exposing the Soviet myth in a story that could be easily understood by almost anyone and which could be easily translated into other languages The revolt of the animals against Farmer Jones is Orwell analogy with the October Bolshevik Revolution and Jones attempt to regain control with the aid of neighbouring farmers parallels the Western powers efforts of to crush the Bolsheviks The pigs rise to mirrors the rise of a Stalinist bureaucracy in the USSR just as Napoleon emergence as the farm sole leader reflects Stalin emergence The pigs appropriation of milk and apples for their own use the turning point of the story as Orwell termed it in a letter to Dwight Macdonald stands as an analogy for the crushing of the Kronstadt revolt against the Bolsheviks and the difficult efforts of the animals to build the windmill suggest the various Five Year Plans The puppies controlled by Napoleon parallel the nurture of the secret police in the Stalinist structure and the pigs treatment of the other animals on the farm recalls the internal terror faced by the populace in the In chapter seven when the animals confess their nonexistent crimes and are killed Orwell directly alludes to the purges confessions and show trials of the late These contributed to Orwell conviction that the Bolshevik revolution had been corrupted and the Soviet system become rotten Peter Edgerly Firchow and Peter Davison consider that in real life with events in Animal Farm mirroring those in the Soviet Union the Battle of the Windmill represents the Great Patriotic War World War II especially the Battle of Stalingrad and the Battle of Moscow During the battle Frederick drills a hole and places explosives inside and then All the animals including Napoleon took cover Orwell had the publisher alter this to All the animals except Napoleon in recognition of Joseph Stalin decision to remain in Moscow during the German advance This very particular alteration had been occasioned by Orwell having been in Paris in March working as a war correspondent for the Observer and the Manchester Evening News In Paris he met Joseph Czapski a survivor of the Katyn Massacre In spite of Czapski opposition to the Soviet regime he told Orwell as Orwell wrote to Arthur Koestler that it had been the character greatness of Stalin that saved Russia from the German invasion The Battle of the Cowshed has been said to represent the allied invasion of Soviet Russia in and the defeat of the White Russians in the Russian Civil War Other connections that writers have suggested illustrate Orwell telescoping of Russian history from to include the wave of rebelliousness that ran through the countryside after the Rebellion which stands for the abortive revolutions in Hungary and in Germany Ch IV the conflict between Napoleon and Snowball Ch V paralleling the two rival and beliefs that seemed pitted against one another Trotskyism with its faith in the revolutionary vocation of the proletariat of the West and Stalinism with its glorification of Russia socialist destiny Napoleon dealings with Whymper and the Willingdon markets Ch VI paralleling the Treaty of Rapallo and Frederick bank notes paralleling the pact of August which are forgeries Frederick attacks Animal Farm without warning and destroys the windmill The book close with the pigs and men in a kind of rapprochement reflected Orwell view of the Teheran Conference that seemed to display the establishment of the best possible relations between the USSR and the West but in reality were destined as Orwell presciently predicted to continue to unravel The disagreement between the allies and the start of the Cold War is suggested when Napoleon and Pilkington both suspicious played an ace of spades simultaneously Adaptations A BBC radio version produced by Rayner Heppenstall was broadcast in January Orwell listened to the production at his home in Canonbury Square in London with Hugh Gordon Porteous amongst others Orwell later wrote to Heppenstall that Porteous who had not read the book grasped what was happening after a few minutes A further radio production again using Orwell own dramatisation of the book was broadcast in January on BBC Radio Four Tamsin Greig narrated and the cast included Nicky Henson as Napoleon Toby Jones as the propagandist Squealer and Ralph Ineson as Boxer Animal Farm has been adapted to film twice The Animal Farm film was an animated feature and the Animal Farm film was a TV live action version Both differ from the novel and have been accused of taking significant liberties including sanitising some aspects In the version Napoleon is apparently overthrown in a second revolution The film shows Napoleon regime collapsing in on itself with the farm having new human owners reflecting the collapse of Soviet communism appropriating the new political reality to the story In a version of Animal Farm potentially directed by Andy Serkis was announced A theatrical version with music by Richard Peaslee and lyrics by Adrian Mitchell was staged at the National Theatre London on April directed by Peter Hall It toured nine cities in A solo version adapted and performed by Guy Masterson premi red at the Traverse Theatre Edinburgh in January and has toured worldwide since Editions On July withdrew certain Amazon Kindle titles including
