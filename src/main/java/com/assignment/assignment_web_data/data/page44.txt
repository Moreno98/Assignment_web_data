Alkane In organic chemistry an alkane or paraffin a historical name that also has other meanings is a saturated hydrocarbon Alkanes consist only of hydrogen and carbon atoms and all bonds are single bonds Alkanes technically always acyclic have the general chemical formula Alkanes belong to a homologous series of organic compounds in which the members differ by a molecular mass of u mass of a methanediyl group one carbon atom of mass u and two hydrogen atoms of mass u each There are two main commercial sources crude oil and natural gas Each carbon atom has bonds either or bonds and each hydrogen atom is joined to a carbon atom bonds A series of linked carbon atoms is known as the carbon skeleton or carbon backbone The number of carbon atoms is used to define the size of the alkane An alkyl group generally abbreviated with the symbol R is a functional group or that like an alkane consists solely of carbon and hydrogen atoms for example a methyl or ethyl group The simplest possible alkane the parent molecule is methane There is no limit to the number of carbon atoms that can be linked together the only limitation being that the molecule is acyclic is saturated and is a hydrocarbon Saturated oils and waxes are examples of larger alkanes where the number of carbons in the carbon backbone is greater than Alkanes are not very reactive and have little biological activity All alkanes are colourless and odourless Alkanes can be viewed as a molecular tree upon which can be hung the more biologically portions functional groups of the molecule Structure classification Saturated hydrocarbons are hydrocarbons having only single covalent bonds between their carbons They can be According to the definition by IUPAC the former two are alkanes whereas the third group is called cycloalkanes Saturated hydrocarbons can also combine any of the linear cyclic polycyclic and branching structures the general formula is where k is the number of independent loops Alkanes are the acyclic loopless ones corresponding to k Isomerism Alkanes with more than three carbon atoms can be arranged in various different ways forming structural isomers The simplest isomer of an alkane is the one in which the carbon atoms are arranged in a single chain with no branches This isomer is sometimes called the n isomer n for normal although it is not necessarily the most common However the chain of carbon atoms may also be branched at one or more points The number of possible isomers increases rapidly with the number of carbon atoms For example Branched alkanes can be chiral For example and its higher homologues are chiral due to their stereogenic center at carbon atom number In addition to the alkane isomers the chain of carbon atoms may form one or more loops Such compounds are called cycloalkanes Nomenclature The IUPAC nomenclature systematic way of naming compounds for alkanes is based on identifying hydrocarbon chains Unbranched saturated hydrocarbon chains are named systematically with a Greek numerical prefix denoting the number of carbons and the suffix ane In August Wilhelm von Hofmann suggested systematizing nomenclature by using the whole sequence of vowels a e i o and u to create suffixes ane ene ine or yne one une for the hydrocarbons Now the first three name hydrocarbons with single double and triple bonds one represents a ketone ol represents an alcohol or OH group oxy means an ether and refers to oxygen between two carbons so that is the IUPAC name for dimethyl ether It is difficult or impossible to find compounds with more than one IUPAC name This is because shorter chains attached to longer chains are prefixes and the convention includes brackets Numbers in the name referring to which carbon a group is attached to should be as low as possible so that is implied and usually omitted from names of organic compounds with only one Symmetric compounds will have two ways of arriving at the same name Linear alkanes alkanes are sometimes indicated by the prefix n for normal where a isomer exists Although this is not strictly necessary the usage is still common in cases where there is an important difference in properties between the and isomers n hexane or or The members of the series in terms of number of carbon atoms are named as follows The first four names were derived from methanol ether propionic acid and butyric acid respectively Alkanes with five or more carbon atoms are named by adding the suffix ane to the appropriate numerical multiplier prefix with elision of any terminal vowel a or o from the basic numerical term Hence pentane hexane heptane octane The prefix is generally Greek however alkanes with a carbon atom count ending in nine for example nonane use the Latin prefix non For a more complete list see List of alkanes Branched alkanes Simple branched alkanes often have a common name using a prefix to distinguish them from linear alkanes for example n pentane isopentane and neopentane IUPAC naming conventions can be used to produce a systematic name The key steps in the naming of more complicated branched alkanes are as follows Cyclic alkanes cyclic alkanes are in the technical sense not alkanes but cycloalkanes They are hydrocarbons just like alkanes but contain one or more rings Simple cycloalkanes have a prefix cyclo to distinguish them from alkanes Cycloalkanes are named as per their acyclic counterparts with respect to the number of carbon atoms cyclopentane is a cycloalkane with carbon atoms just like pentane but they are joined up in a ring In a similar manner propane and cyclopropane butane and cyclobutane Substituted cycloalkanes are named similar to substituted alkanes the cycloalkane ring is stated and the substituents are according to their position on the ring with the numbering decided by rules Trivial names The trivial name for alkanes is paraffins Together alkanes are known as the paraffin series Trivial names for compounds are usually historical artifacts They were coined before the development of systematic names and have been retained due to familiar usage in industry Cycloalkanes are also called naphthenes It is almost certain that the term paraffin stems from the petrochemical industry alkanes are called isoparaffins The use of the term paraffin is a general term and often does not distinguish between pure compounds and mixtures of isomers compounds with the same chemical formula pentane and isopentane The following trivial names are retained in the IUPAC system Physical properties All alkanes are colourless and odourless Boiling point Alkanes experience van der Waals forces Stronger van der Waals forces give rise to greater boiling points of alkanes There are two determinants for the strength of the van der Waals forces Under standard conditions from to alkanes are gaseous from to they are liquids and after they are solids As the boiling point of alkanes is primarily determined by weight it should not be a surprise that the boiling point has almost a linear relationship with the size molecular weight of the molecule As a rule of thumb the boiling point rises C for each carbon added to the chain this rule applies to other homologous series A alkane will have a boiling point higher than a alkane due to the greater surface area in contact thus the greater van der Waals forces between adjacent molecules For example compare isobutane and butane which boil at and C and and which boil at and C respectively For the latter case two molecules can lock into each other better than the hence the greater van der Waals forces On the other hand cycloalkanes tend to have higher boiling points than their linear counterparts due to the locked conformations of the molecules which give a plane of intermolecular contact Melting points The melting points of the alkanes follow a similar trend to boiling points for the same reason as outlined above That is all other things being equal the larger the molecule the higher the melting point There is one significant difference between boiling points and melting points Solids have more rigid and fixed structure than liquids This rigid structure requires energy to break down Thus the better put together solid structures will require more energy to break apart For alkanes this can be seen from the graph above the blue line The alkanes have a lower trend in melting points than even numbered alkanes This is because even numbered alkanes pack well in the solid phase forming a structure which requires more energy to break apart The alkanes pack less well and so the looser organized solid packing structure requires less energy to break apart The melting points of alkanes can be either higher or lower than those of the corresponding alkanes again depending on the ability of the alkane in question to pack well in the solid phase This is particularly true for isoalkanes isomers which often have melting points higher than those of the linear analogues Conductivity and solubility Alkanes do not conduct electricity nor are they substantially polarized by an electric field For this reason they do not form hydrogen bonds and are insoluble in polar solvents such as water Since the hydrogen bonds between individual water molecules are aligned away from an alkane molecule the coexistence of an alkane and water leads to an increase in molecular order a reduction in entropy As there is no significant bonding between water molecules and alkane molecules the second law of thermodynamics suggests that this reduction in entropy should be minimized by minimizing the contact between alkane and water Alkanes are said to be hydrophobic in that they repel water Their solubility in nonpolar solvents is relatively good a property that is called lipophilicity Different alkanes are for example miscible in all proportions among themselves The density of the alkanes usually increases with increasing number of carbon atoms but remains less than that of water Hence alkanes form the upper layer in an mixture Molecular geometry The molecular structure of the alkanes directly affects their physical and chemical characteristics It is derived from the electron configuration of carbon which has four valence electrons The carbon atoms in alkanes are always hybridized that is to say that the valence electrons are said to be in four equivalent orbitals derived from the combination of the orbital and the three orbitals These orbitals which have identical energies are arranged spatially in the form of a tetrahedron the angle of cos between them Bond lengths and bond angles An alkane molecule has only C H and C C single bonds The former result from the overlap of a of carbon with the of a hydrogen the latter by the overlap of two on different carbon atoms The bond lengths amount to m for a C H bond and m for a C C bond The spatial arrangement of the bonds is similar to that of the four they are tetrahedrally arranged with an angle of between them Structural formulae that represent the bonds as being at right angles to one another while both common and useful do not correspond with the reality Conformation The structural formula and the bond angles are not usually sufficient to completely describe the geometry of a molecule There is a further degree of freedom for each carbon carbon bond the torsion angle between the atoms or groups bound to the atoms at each end of the bond The spatial arrangement described by the torsion angles of the molecule is known as its conformation Ethane forms the simplest case for studying the conformation of alkanes as there is only one C C bond If one looks down the axis of the C C bond one will see the Newman projection The hydrogen atoms on both the front and rear carbon atoms have an angle of between them resulting from the projection of the base of the tetrahedron onto a flat plane However the torsion angle between a given hydrogen atom attached to the front carbon and a given hydrogen atom attached to the rear carbon can vary freely between and This is a consequence of the free rotation about a carbon carbon single bond Despite this apparent freedom only two limiting conformations are important eclipsed conformation and staggered conformation The two conformations also known as rotamers differ in energy The staggered conformation is lower in energy more stable than the eclipsed conformation the least stable This difference in energy between the two conformations known as the torsion energy is low compared to the thermal energy of an ethane molecule at ambient temperature There is constant rotation about the bond The time taken for an ethane molecule to pass from one staggered conformation to the next equivalent to the rotation of one by relative to the other is of the order of seconds The case of higher alkanes is more complex but based on similar principles with the antiperiplanar conformation always being the most favored around each bond For this reason alkanes are usually shown in a zigzag arrangement in diagrams or in models The actual structure will always differ somewhat from these idealized forms as the differences in energy between the conformations are small compared to the thermal energy of the molecules Alkane molecules have no fixed structural form whatever the models may suggest Spectroscopic properties Virtually all organic compounds contain carbon carbon and carbon hydrogen bonds and so show some of the features of alkanes in their spectra Alkanes are notable for having no other groups and therefore for the absence of other characteristic spectroscopic features of different functional group like OH CHO COOH Infrared spectroscopy The carbon hydrogen stretching mode gives a strong absorption between and cm while the carbon carbon stretching mode absorbs between and cm The carbon hydrogen bending modes depend on the nature of the group methyl groups show bands at cm and cm while methylene groups show bands at cm and cm Carbon chains with more than four carbon atoms show a weak absorption at around cm NMR spectroscopy The proton resonances of alkanes are usually found at H The resonances depend on the number of hydrogen atoms attached to the carbon C primary methyl secondary methylene tertiary methyne and quaternary The resonance of quaternary carbon atoms is characteristically weak due to the lack of Nuclear Overhauser effect and the long relaxation time and can be missed in weak samples or samples that have not been run for a sufficiently long time Mass spectrometry Alkanes have a high ionization energy and the molecular ion is usually weak The fragmentation pattern can be difficult to interpret but in the case of branched chain alkanes the carbon chain is preferentially cleaved at tertiary or quaternary carbons due to the relative stability of the resulting free radicals The fragment resulting from the loss of a single methyl group M is often absent and other fragment are often spaced by intervals of fourteen mass units corresponding to sequential loss of Chemical properties Alkanes are only weakly reactive with ionic and other polar substances The acid dissociation constant pKa values of all alkanes are above hence they are practically inert to acids and bases see carbon acids This inertness is the source of the term paraffins with the meaning here of lacking affinity In crude oil the alkane molecules have remained chemically unchanged for millions of years However redox reactions of alkanes in particular with oxygen and the halogens are possible as the carbon atoms are in a strongly reduced condition in the case of methane the lowest possible oxidation state for carbon is reached Reaction with oxygen if present in sufficient quantity to satisfy the reaction stoichiometry leads to combustion without any smoke producing carbon dioxide and water Free radical halogenation reactions occur with halogens leading to the production of haloalkanes In addition alkanes have been shown to interact with and bind to certain transition metal complexes in See bond activation Free radicals molecules with unpaired electrons play a large role in most reactions of alkanes such as cracking and reformation where alkanes are converted into alkanes and alkanes into isomers In highly branched alkanes the bond angle may differ significantly from the optimal value in order to allow the different groups sufficient space This causes a tension in the molecule known as steric hindrance and can substantially increase the reactivity Reactions with oxygen combustion reaction All alkanes react with oxygen in a combustion reaction although they become increasingly difficult to ignite as the number of carbon atoms increases The general equation for complete combustion is or C n n n n In the absence of sufficient oxygen carbon monoxide or even soot can be formed as shown below For example methane See the alkane heat of formation table for detailed data The standard enthalpy change of combustion c H o for alkanes increases by about per group alkanes have lower values of c H o than alkanes of the same number of carbon atoms and so can be seen to be somewhat more stable Reactions with halogens Alkanes react with halogens in a free radical halogenation reaction The hydrogen atoms of the alkane are progressively replaced by halogen atoms are the reactive species that participate in the reaction which usually leads to a mixture of products The reaction is highly exothermic and can lead to an explosion These reactions are an important industrial route to halogenated hydrocarbons There are three steps Experiments have shown that all halogenation produces a mixture of all possible isomers indicating that all hydrogen atoms are susceptible to reaction The mixture produced however is not a statistical mixture Secondary and tertiary hydrogen atoms are preferentially replaced due to the greater stability of secondary and tertiary An example can be seen in the monobromination of propane the Figure below the Statistical Distribution should be and Cracking Cracking breaks larger molecules into smaller ones This can be done with a thermal or catalytic method The thermal cracking process follows a homolytic mechanism with formation of The catalytic cracking process involves the presence of acid catalysts usually solid acids such as and zeolites which promote a heterolytic asymmetric breakage of bonds yielding pairs of ions of opposite charges usually a carbocation and the very unstable hydride anion and cations are both highly unstable and undergo processes of chain rearrangement scission in position beta cracking and intra and intermolecular hydrogen transfer or hydride transfer In both types of processes the corresponding reactive intermediates radicals ions are permanently regenerated and thus they proceed by a chain mechanism The chain of reactions is eventually terminated by radical or ion recombination Isomerization and reformation Dragan and his colleague were the first to report about isomerization in alkanes Isomerization and reformation are processes in which alkanes are heated in the presence of a platinum catalyst In isomerization the alkanes become isomers In other words it does not lose any carbons or hydrogens keeping the same molecular weight In reformation the alkanes become cycloalkanes or aromatic hydrocarbons giving off hydrogen as a Both of these processes raise the octane number of the substance Butane is the most common alkane that is put under the process of isomerization as it makes many branched alkanes with high octane numbers Other reactions Alkanes will react with steam in the presence of a nickel catalyst to give hydrogen Alkanes can be chlorosulfonated and nitrated although both reactions require special conditions The fermentation of alkanes to carboxylic acids is of some technical importance In the Reed reaction sulfur dioxide chlorine and light convert hydrocarbons to sulfonyl chlorides Nucleophilic Abstraction can be used to separate an alkane from a metal Alkyl groups can be transferred from one compound to another by transmetalation reactions Occurrence Occurrence of alkanes in the Universe Alkanes form a small portion of the atmospheres of the outer gas planets such as Jupiter methane ethane Saturn methane ethane Uranus methane ethane and Neptune methane ppm ethane Titan methane a satellite of Saturn was examined by the Huygens probe which indicated that Titan atmosphere periodically rains liquid methane onto the moon surface Also on Titan the Cassini mission has imaged seasonal lakes near the polar regions of Titan Methane and ethane have also been detected in the tail of the comet Hyakutake Chemical analysis showed that the abundances of ethane and methane were roughly equal which is thought to imply that its ices formed in interstellar space away from the Sun which would have evaporated these volatile molecules Alkanes have also been detected in meteorites such as carbonaceous chondrites Occurrence of alkanes on Earth Traces of methane gas about or ppb occur in the Earth atmosphere produced primarily by methanogenic microorganisms such as Archaea in the gut of ruminants The most important commercial sources for alkanes are natural gas and oil Natural gas contains primarily methane and ethane with some propane and butane oil is a mixture of liquid alkanes and other hydrocarbons These hydrocarbons were formed when marine animals and plants zooplankton and phytoplankton died and sank to the bottom of ancient seas and were covered with sediments in an anoxic environment and converted over many millions of years at high temperatures and high pressure to their current form Natural gas resulted thereby for example from the following reaction These hydrocarbon deposits collected in porous rocks trapped beneath impermeable cap rocks comprise commercial oil fields They have formed over millions of years and once exhausted can not be readily replaced The depletion of these hydrocarbons reserves is the basis for what is known as the energy crisis Methane is also present in what is called biogas produced by animals and decaying matter which is a possible renewable energy source Alkanes have a low solubility in water so the content in the oceans is negligible however at high pressures and low temperatures such as at the bottom of the oceans methane can with water to form a solid methane clathrate methane hydrate Although this can not be commercially exploited at the present time the amount of combustible energy of the known methane clathrate fields exceeds the energy content of all the natural gas and oil deposits put together Methane extracted from methane clathrate is therefore a candidate for future fuels Biological occurrence Acyclic alkanes occur in nature in various ways Certain types of bacteria can metabolize alkanes they prefer carbon chains as they are easier to degrade than chains On the other hand certain archaea the methanogens produce large quantities of methane by the metabolism of carbon dioxide or other oxidized organic compounds The energy is released by the oxidation of hydrogen Methanogens are also the producers of marsh gas in wetlands and release about two billion tonnes of methane per year the atmospheric content of this gas is produced nearly exclusively by them The methane output of cattle and other herbivores which can release up to liters per day and of termites is also due to methanogens They also produce this simplest of all alkanes in the intestines of humans Methanogenic archaea are hence at the end of the carbon cycle with carbon being released back into the atmosphere after having been fixed by photosynthesis It is probable that our current deposits of natural gas were formed in a similar way Alkanes also play a role if a minor role in the biology of the three eukaryotic groups of organisms fungi plants and animals Some specialized yeasts Candida tropicale Pichia Rhodotorula can use alkanes as a source of carbon energy The fungus Amorphotheca resinae prefers the alkanes in aviation fuel and can cause serious problems for aircraft in tropical regions In plants the solid alkanes are found in the plant cuticle and epicuticular wax of many species but are only rarely major constituents They protect the plant against water loss prevent the leaching of important minerals by the rain and protect against bacteria fungi and harmful insects The carbon chains in plant alkanes are usually between and carbon atoms in length and are made by the plants by decarboxylation of fatty acids The exact composition of the layer of wax is not only but changes also with the season and such environmental factors as lighting conditions temperature or humidity More volatile alkanes are also produced by and found in plant tissues The Jeffrey pine is noted for producing exceptionally high levels of in its resin for which reason its distillate was designated as the zero point for one octane rating Floral scents have also long been known to contain volatile alkane components and is a significant component in the scent of some roses Emission of gaseous and volatile alkanes such as ethane pentane and hexane by plants has also been documented at low levels though they are not generally considered to be a major component of biogenic air pollution Edible vegetable oils also typically contain small fractions of biogenic alkanes with a wide spectrum of carbon numbers mainly to usually peaking in the low to upper with concentrations up to dozens of milligrams per kilogram parts per million by weight and sometimes over a hundred for the total alkane fraction Alkanes are found in animal products although they are less important than unsaturated hydrocarbons One example is the shark liver oil which is approximately pristane They are important as pheromones chemical messenger materials on which insects depend for communication In some species the support beetle Xylotrechus colonus pentacosane and are transferred by body contact With others like the tsetse fly Glossina morsitans morsitans the pheromone contains the four alkanes and and acts by smell over longer distances honey bees produce and release two alkanes tricosane and pentacosane Ecological relations One example in which both plant and animal alkanes play a role is the ecological relationship between the sand bee Andrena nigroaenea and the early spider orchid Ophrys sphegodes the latter is dependent for pollination on the former Sand bees use pheromones in order to identify a mate in the case of nigroaenea the females emit a mixture of tricosane pentacosane and heptacosane in the ratio and males are attracted by specifically this odor The orchid takes advantage of this mating arrangement to get the male bee to collect and disseminate its pollen parts of its flower not only resemble the appearance of sand bees but also produce large quantities of the three alkanes in the same ratio as female sand bees As a result numerous males are lured to the blooms and attempt to copulate with their imaginary partner although this endeavor is not crowned with success for the bee it allows the orchid to transfer its pollen which will be dispersed after the departure of the frustrated male to different blooms Production Petroleum refining As stated earlier the most important source of alkanes is natural gas and crude oil Alkanes are separated in an oil refinery by fractional distillation and processed into many different products The process is a method to synthesize liquid hydrocarbons including alkanes from carbon monoxide and hydrogen This method is used to produce substitutes for petroleum distillates Laboratory preparation There is usually little need for alkanes to be synthesized in the laboratory since they are usually commercially available Also alkanes are generally chemically or biologically and do not undergo functional group interconversions cleanly When alkanes are produced in the laboratory it is often a of a reaction For example the use of n butyllithium as a strong base gives the conjugate acid as a However at times it may be desirable to make a portion of a molecule into an alkane like functionality alkyl group using the above or similar methods For example an ethyl group is an alkyl group when this is attached to a hydroxy group it gives ethanol which is not an alkane To do so the methods are hydrogenation of alkenes Alkanes or alkyl groups can also be prepared directly from alkyl halides in the reaction The deoxygenation removes hydroxyl groups from alcohols and the Clemmensen reduction removes carbonyl groups from aldehydes and ketones to form alkanes or compounds Applications The applications of a certain alkane can be determined quite well according to the number of carbon atoms The first four alkanes are used mainly for heating and cooking purposes and in some countries for electricity generation Methane and ethane are the main components of natural gas they are normally stored as gases under pressure It is however easier to transport them as liquids This requires both compression and cooling of the gas Propane and butane can be liquefied at fairly low pressures and are well known as liquified petroleum gas LPG Propane for example is used in the propane gas burner and as a fuel for cars butane in disposable cigarette lighters The two alkanes are used as propellants in aerosol sprays From pentane to octane the alkanes are reasonably volatile liquids They are used as fuels in internal combustion engines as they vaporise easily on entry into the combustion chamber without forming droplets which would impair the uniformity of the combustion alkanes are preferred as they are much less prone to premature ignition which causes knocking than their homologues This propensity to premature ignition is measured by the octane rating of the fuel where isooctane has an arbitrary value of and heptane has a value of zero Apart from their use as fuels the middle alkanes are also good solvents for nonpolar substances Alkanes from nonane to for instance hexadecane an alkane with sixteen carbon atoms are liquids of higher viscosity less and less suitable for use in gasoline They form instead the major part of diesel and aviation fuel Diesel fuels are characterized by their cetane number cetane being an old name for hexadecane However the higher melting points of these alkanes can cause problems at low temperatures and in polar regions where the fuel becomes too thick to flow correctly Alkanes from hexadecane upwards form the most important components of fuel oil and lubricating oil In the latter function they work at the same time as agents as their hydrophobic nature means that water can not reach the metal surface Many solid alkanes find use as paraffin wax for example in candles This should not be confused however with true wax which consists primarily of esters Alkanes with a chain length of approximately or more carbon atoms are found in bitumen used for example in road surfacing However the higher alkanes have little value and are usually split into lower alkanes by cracking Some synthetic polymers such as polyethylene and polypropylene are alkanes with chains containing hundreds of thousands of carbon atoms These materials are used in innumerable applications and billions of kilograms of these materials are made and used each year Environmental transformations When released in the environment alkanes do undergo rapid biodegradation because they have no functional groups like hydroxyl or carbonyl that are needed by most organisms in order to metabolize the compound However some bacteria can metabolize some alkanes especially those linear and short by oxidizing the terminal carbon atom The product is an alcohol that could be next oxidized to an aldehyde and finally to a carboxylic acid The resulting fatty acid could be metabolized through the fatty acid degradation pathway Hazards Methane is explosive when mixed with air Other lower alkanes can also form explosive mixtures with air The lighter liquid alkanes are highly flammable although this risk decreases with the length of the carbon chain Pentane hexane heptane and octane are classed as dangerous for the environment and harmful Considerations for detection risk control
