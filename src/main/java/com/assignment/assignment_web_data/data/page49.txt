America the Beautiful America the Beautiful is an American patriotic song The lyrics were written by Katharine Lee Bates and the music was composed by church organist and choirmaster Samuel Ward Bates originally wrote the words as a poem Pikes Peak first published in the Fourth of July edition of the church periodical The Congregationalist in At that time the poem was titled America for publication Ward had originally written the music Materna for the hymn O Mother dear Jerusalem in though it was not first published until Ward music combined with the Bates poem was first published in and titled America the Beautiful The song is one of the most popular of the many American patriotic songs History In at the age of Bates an English professor at Wellesley College had taken a train trip to Colorado Springs Colorado to teach a short summer school session at Colorado College Several of the sights on her trip inspired her and they found their way into her poem including the World Columbian Exposition in Chicago the White City with its promise of the future contained within its alabaster buildings the wheat fields of America heartland Kansas through which her train was riding on July and the majestic view of the Great Plains from high atop Zebulon Pikes Peak On the pinnacle of that mountain the words of the poem started to come to her and she wrote them down upon returning to her hotel room at the original Antlers Hotel The poem was initially published two years later in The Congregationalist to commemorate the Fourth of July It quickly caught the public fancy Amended versions were published in and Several existing pieces of music were adapted to the poem A hymn tune composed by Samuel Ward was generally considered the best music as early as and is still the popular tune today Just as Bates had been inspired to write her poem Ward too was inspired to compose his tune The tune came to him while he was on a ferryboat trip from Coney Island back to his home in New York City after a leisurely summer day in and he immediately wrote it down He was so anxious to capture the tune in his head he asked fellow passenger friend Harry Martin for his shirt cuff to write the tune on He composed the tune for the old hymn O Mother Dear Jerusalem retitling the work Materna Ward music combined with Bates poem were first published together in and titled America the Beautiful Ward died in not knowing the national stature his music would attain since the music was only first applied to the song in Bates was more fortunate since the song popularity was well established by the time of her death in At various times in the more than years that have elapsed since the song was written particularly during the John Kennedy administration there have been efforts to give America the Beautiful legal status either as a national hymn or as a national anthem equal to or in place of The Banner but so far this has not succeeded Proponents prefer America the Beautiful for various reasons saying it is easier to sing more melodic and more adaptable to new orchestrations while still remaining as easily recognizable as The Banner Some prefer America the Beautiful over The Banner due to the latter imagery Others prefer The Banner for the same reason While that national dichotomy has stymied any effort at changing the tradition of the national anthem America the Beautiful continues to be held in high esteem by a large number of Americans The melody of this song was the school song of the former University of Shanghai which closed in Currently it is used by Shanghai Alumni Primary School in Hong Kong and Hujiang High School in Taiwan as the melody of their school song At Colorado College where Bates was teaching at the time of writing it America the Beautiful is commonly sung at events such as convocations commencement and baccalaureate and has become somewhat of a second anthem for the school When Richard Nixon visited China in this song was played as the welcome music This song was used as the background music of the television broadcast of the launch The song is often included in songbooks in a wide variety of religious congregations in

mountain majesties refers to the shade of the Rocky Mountains which Bates looked at while writing the poem Books Lynn Sherr book America the Beautiful discusses the origins of the song and the
