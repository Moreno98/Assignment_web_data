Alchemy Alchemy is an influential tradition whose practitioners have from antiquity claimed it to be the precursor to profound powers The defining objectives of alchemy are varied but historically have typically included one or more of the following goals the creation of the fabled philosopher stone the ability to transmute base metals into the noble metals gold or silver and development of an elixir of life which would confer youth and longevity Though alchemy played a significant role in the development of early modern science it differs significantly from modern science in its inclusion of Hermetic principles and practices related to mythology magic religion and spirituality It is recognized as a protoscience that contributed to the development of modern chemistry and medicine Alchemists developed a structure of basic laboratory techniques theory terminology and experimental method some of which are still in use today However alchemists predated modern foundations of chemistry such as scientific skepticism atomic theory the modern understanding of a chemical element and a chemical substance the periodic table and conservation of mass and stoichiometry Instead they believed in four elements and phlogiston and cryptic symbolism and mysticism was an integral part of alchemical work Overview The ostensible goals of alchemy are often given as the transmutation of common metals into gold known as chrysopoeia the creation of a panacea and the discovery of a universal solvent However these only highlight certain aspects of alchemy Alchemists have historically rewritten and evolved their explanation of alchemy so it is difficult to define it simply Sheppard gives the following as a comprehensive summary Modern discussions of alchemy are generally split into an examination of its exoteric practical applications and its esoteric aspects The former is pursued by historians of the physical sciences who have examined the subject in terms of protochemistry medicine and charlatanism The latter interests psychologists spiritual and new age communities hermetic philosophers and historians of esotericism The subject has also made an ongoing impact on literature and the arts Despite the modern split numerous sources stress an integration of esoteric and exoteric approaches to alchemy Holmyard when writing on exoteric aspects states that they can not be properly appreciated if the esoteric is not always kept in mind The prototype for this model can be found in Bolos of Mendes BCE work Physika kai Mystika On Physical and Mystical Matters von Franz tells us the double approach of Western alchemy was set from the start when Greek philosophy was mixed with Egyptian and Mesopotamian technology The technological operative approach which she calls extraverted and the mystic contemplative psychological one which she calls introverted are not mutually exclusive but complementary since meditation requires practice in the real world and vice versa Relation to chemistry Practical applications of alchemy produced a wide range of contributions to medicine and the physical sciences The alchemist Robert Boyle is credited as being the father of chemistry Paracelsian iatrochemistry emphasized the medicinal application of alchemy continued in plant alchemy or spagyric Studies of alchemy also influenced Isaac Newton theory of gravity Academic historical research supports that the alchemists were searching for a material substance using physical methods Alchemists made contributions to the chemical industries of the day ore testing and refining metalworking production of gunpowder ink dyes paints cosmetics leather tanning ceramics glass manufacture preparation of extracts liquors and so on Alchemists contributed distillation to Western Europe The attempts of alchemists to arrange information on substances so as to clarify and anticipate the products of their chemical reactions resulted in early conceptions of chemical elements and the first rudimentary periodic tables They learned how to extract metals from ores and how to compose many types of inorganic acids and bases During the century practical alchemy started to disappear in favor of its younger offshoot chemistry as it was renamed by Robert Boyle the father of modern chemistry In his book The Skeptical Chymist Boyle attacked Paracelsus and the natural philosophy of Aristotle which was taught at universities However Boyle biographers in their emphasis that he laid the foundations of modern chemistry neglect how steadily he clung to the scholastic sciences and to alchemy in theory practice and doctrine The decline of alchemy continued in the century with the birth of modern chemistry which provided a more precise and reliable framework within a new view of the universe based on rational materialism Relation to Hermeticism In the eyes of a variety of esoteric and Hermetic practitioners the heart of alchemy is spiritual Transmutation of lead into gold is presented as an analogy for personal transmutation purification and perfection This approach is often termed spiritual esoteric or internal alchemy Early alchemists such as Zosimos of Panopolis AD highlight the spiritual nature of the alchemical quest symbolic of a religious regeneration of the human soul This approach continued in the Middle Ages as metaphysical aspects substances physical states and material processes were used as metaphors for spiritual entities spiritual states and ultimately transformation In this sense the literal meanings of Alchemical Formulas were a blind hiding their true spiritual philosophy Practitioners and patrons such as Melchior Cibinensis and Pope Innocent VIII existed within the ranks of the church while Martin Luther applauded alchemy for its consistency with Christian teachings Both the transmutation of common metals into gold and the universal panacea symbolized evolution from an imperfect diseased corruptible and ephemeral state toward a perfect healthy incorruptible and everlasting state so the philosopher stone then represented a mystic key that would make this evolution possible Applied to the alchemist himself the twin goal symbolized his evolution from ignorance to enlightenment and the stone represented a hidden spiritual truth or power that would lead to that goal In texts that are written according to this view the cryptic alchemical symbols diagrams and textual imagery of late alchemical works typically contain multiple layers of meanings allegories and references to other equally cryptic works and must be laboriously decoded to discover their true meaning In his Alchemical Catechism Th odore Henri de Tschudi denotes that the usage of the metals was a symbol During the renaissance alchemy broke into more distinct schools placing spiritual alchemists in high contrast with those working with literal metals and chemicals While most spiritual alchemists also incorporate elements of exotericism examples of a purely spiritual alchemy can be traced back as far as the century when Jacob Boehme used alchemical terminology in strictly mystical writings Another example can be found in the work of Heinrich Khunrath who viewed the process of transmutation as occurring within the alchemist spirit The recent work of Principe and William Newman seeks to reject the spiritual interpretation of alchemy especially as applied to medieval and alchemy stating it arose as a product of the Victorian occult revival There is evidence to support that some classical alchemical sources were adulterated during this time to give greater weight to the spiritual aspects of alchemy Despite this other scholars such as Calian and Tilton reject this view as entirely historically inaccurate drawing examples of historical spiritual alchemy from Boehme Isaac Newton and Michael Maier Etymology The word alchemy was borrowed from Old French alquemie alkimie taken from Medieval Latin alchymia and which is in turn borrowed from Arabic miy philosopher stone The Arabic word is borrowed from Late Greek ch me a ch m a black magic with the agglutination of the Arabic definite article al This ancient Greek word was derived from the early Greek name for Egypt Ch mia based on the Egyptian name for Egypt k me hieroglyphic khmi lit black earth as opposed to red desert sand The Medieval Latin form was influenced by Greek chymeia meaning mixture and referring to pharmaceutical chemistry History Alchemy covers several philosophical traditions spanning some four millennia and three continents These traditions general penchant for cryptic and symbolic language makes it hard to trace their mutual influences and genetic relationships One can distinguish at least three major strands which appear to be largely independent at least in their earlier stages Chinese alchemy centered in China and its zone of cultural influence Indian alchemy centered around the Indian subcontinent and Western alchemy which occurred around the Mediterranean and whose center has shifted over the millennia from Egypt to the Islamic world and finally medieval Europe Chinese alchemy was closely connected to Taoism and Indian alchemy with the Dharmic faiths whereas Western alchemy developed its own philosophical system that was largely independent of but influenced by various Western religions It is still an open question whether these three strands share a common origin or to what extent they influenced each other Alchemy in Egypt The start of Western alchemy may generally be traced to Hellenistic Egypt where the city of Alexandria was a center of alchemical knowledge and retained its through most of the Greek and Roman periods Here elements of technology religion mythology and Hellenistic philosophy each with their own much longer histories combined to form the earliest known records of alchemy in the West Zosimos of Panopolis wrote the oldest known books on alchemy while Mary the Jewess is credited as being the first Western alchemist They wrote in Greek and lived in Egypt under Roman rule Mythology Zosimos of Panopolis asserted that alchemy dated back to Pharaonic Egypt where it was the domain of the priestly class though there is little to no evidence for his assertion Alchemical writers used Classical figures from Greek Roman and Egyptian mythology to illuminate their works and allegorize alchemical transmutation These included the pantheon of gods related to the Classical planets Isis Osiris Jason and many others The central figure in the mythology of alchemy is Hermes Trismegistus or Hermes His name is derived from the god Thoth and his Greek counterpart Hermes Hermes and his caduceus or were among alchemy principal symbols According to Clement of Alexandria he wrote what were called the books of Hermes covering all fields of knowledge The Hermetica of Hermes is generally understood to form the basis for Western alchemical philosophy and practice called the hermetic philosophy by its early practitioners These writings were collected in the first centuries of the common era Technology The dawn of Western alchemy is sometimes associated with that of metallurgy extending back to BCE Many writings were lost when the emperor Diocletian ordered the burning of alchemical books after suppressing a revolt in Alexandria CE Few original Egyptian documents on alchemy have survived most notable among them the Stockholm papyrus and the Leyden papyrus Dating from to CE they contained recipes for dyeing and making artificial gemstones cleaning and fabricating pearls and manufacturing of imitation gold and silver These writings lack the mystical philosophical elements of alchemy but do contain the works of Bolus of Mendes or which aligned these recipes with theoretical knowledge of astrology and the Classical elements Between the time of Bolus and Zosimos the change took place that transformed this metallurgy into a Hermetic art Philosophy Alexandria acted as a melting pot for philosophies of Pythagoreanism Platonism Stoicism and Gnosticism which formed the origin of alchemy character An important example of alchemy roots in Greek philosophy originated by Empedocles and developed by Aristotle was that all things in the universe were formed from only four elements earth air water and fire According to Aristotle each element had a sphere to which it belonged and to which it would return if left undisturbed The four elements of the Greek were mostly qualitative aspects of matter not quantitative as our modern elements are True alchemy never regarded earth air water and fire as corporeal or chemical substances in the sense of the word The four elements are simply the primary and most general qualities by means of which the amorphous and purely quantitative substance of all bodies first reveals itself in differentiated form and the Roman emperor Caligula is said to have instituted experiments for producing gold out of orpiment arsenic sulfide Later alchemists extensively developed the mystical aspects of this concept Alchemy coexisted alongside emerging Christianity Lactantius believed Hermes Trismegistus had prophesied its birth Augustine CE later affirmed this but also condemned Trismegistus for idolatry Examples of Pagan Christian and Jewish alchemists can be found during this period Most of the alchemists preceding Zosimos are known only by pseudonyms such as Moses Isis Cleopatra Democritus and Ostanes Others authors such as Komarios and Chymes we only know through fragments of text After CE Greek alchemical writers occupied themselves solely in commenting on the works of these predecessors By the middle of the century alchemy was almost an entirely mystical discipline It was at that time that Khalid Ibn Yazid sparked its migration from Alexandria to the Islamic world facilitating the translation and preservation of Greek alchemical texts in the and centuries Alchemy in the Islamic world After the fall of the Roman Empire the focus of alchemical development moved to the Islamic World Much more is known about Islamic alchemy because it was better documented indeed most of the earlier writings that have come down through the years were preserved as Arabic translations The word alchemy itself was derived from the Arabic word miy The early Islamic world was a melting pot for alchemy Platonic and Aristotelian thought which had already been somewhat appropriated into hermetical science continued to be assimilated during the late and early centuries through Syriac translations and scholarship In the late century J bir ibn Hayy n known as Geber in Europe introduced a new approach to alchemy based on scientific methodology and controlled experimentation in the laboratory in contrast to the ancient Greek and Egyptian alchemists whose works were often allegorical and unintelligible with very little concern for laboratory work Jabir is thus considered by many to be the father of chemistry albeit others reserve that title for Robert Boyle or Antoine Lavoisier The science historian Paul Kraus wrote Jabir himself clearly recognized and proclaimed the importance of experimentation Early Islamic chemists such as Jabir Ibn Hayyan in Arabic Geberus in Latin usually rendered in English as Geber Alkindus and Muhammad ibn Zakar ya R zi Rasis or Rhazes in Latin contributed a number of key chemical discoveries such as the muriatic hydrochloric acid sulfuric and nitric acids and more The discovery that aqua regia a mixture of nitric and hydrochloric acids could dissolve the noblest metal gold was to fuel the imagination of alchemists for the next millennium Islamic philosophers also made great contributions to alchemical hermeticism The most influential author in this regard was arguably Jabir Jabir ultimate goal was Takwin the artificial creation of life in the alchemical laboratory up to and including human life He analyzed each Aristotelian element in terms of four basic qualities of hotness coldness dryness and moistness According to Jabir in each metal two of these qualities were interior and two were exterior For example lead was externally cold and dry while gold was hot and moist Thus Jabir theorized by rearranging the qualities of one metal a different metal would result By this reasoning the search for the philosopher stone was introduced to Western alchemy Jabir developed an elaborate numerology whereby the root letters of a substance name in Arabic when treated with various transformations held correspondences to the element physical properties The elemental system used in medieval alchemy also originated with Jabir His original system consisted of seven elements which included the five classical elements aether air earth fire and water in addition to two chemical elements representing the metals sulphur the stone which burns which characterized the principle of combustibility and mercury which contained the idealized principle of metallic properties Shortly thereafter this evolved into eight elements with the Arabic concept of the three metallic principles sulphur giving flammability or combustion mercury giving volatility and stability and salt giving solidity The atomic theory of corpuscularianism where all physical bodies possess an inner and outer layer of minute particles or corpuscles also has its origins in the work of Jabir From the to centuries alchemical theories faced criticism from a variety of practical Muslim chemists including Alkindus Ab n r n Avicenna and Ibn Khaldun In particular they wrote refutations against the idea of the transmutation of metals Alchemy in medieval Europe The introduction of alchemy to Latin Europe occurred on February with the completion of Robert of Chester translation of the Arabic Book of the Composition of Alchemy Although European craftsmen and technicians preexisted Robert notes in his preface that alchemy was unknown in Latin Europe at the time of his writing The translation of Arabic texts concerning numerous disciplines including alchemy flourished in Toledo Spain through contributors like Gerard of Cremona and Adelard of Bath Translations of the time included the Turba Philosophorum and the works of Avicenna and These brought with them many new words to the European vocabulary for which there was no previous Latin equivalent Alcohol carboy elixir and athanor are examples Meanwhile theologian contemporaries of the translators made strides towards the reconciliation of faith and experimental rationalism thereby priming Europe for the influx of alchemical thought Saint Anselm put forth the opinion that faith and rationalism were compatible and encouraged rationalism in a Christian context Peter Abelard followed Anselm work laying down the foundation for acceptance of Aristotelian thought before the first works of Aristotle had reached the West And later Robert Grosseteste used Abelard methods of analysis and added the use of observation experimentation and conclusions when conducting scientific investigations Grosseteste also did much work to reconcile Platonic and Aristotelian thinking Through much of the and centuries alchemical knowledge in Europe remained centered around translations and new Latin contributions were not made The efforts of the translators were succeeded by that of the encyclopaedists Albertus Magnus and Roger Bacon are the most notable of these Their works explained and summarized the newly imported alchemical knowledge in Aristotelian terms There is little to suggest that Albertus Magnus a Dominican was himself an alchemist In his authentic works such as the Book of Minerals he observed and commented on the operations and theories of alchemical authorities like Hermes and Democritus and unnamed alchemists of his time Albertus critically compared these to the writings of Aristotle and Avicenna where they concerned the transmutation of metals From the time shortly after his death through to the century or more alchemical tracts were misattributed to him a common practice giving rise to his reputation as an accomplished alchemist Likewise alchemical texts have been attributed to Albert student Thomas Aquinas Roger Bacon was an Oxford Franciscan who studied a wide variety of topics including optics languages and medicine After studying the Secretum Secretorum around he dramatically shifted his studies towards a vision of a universal science which included alchemy and astrology Bacon maintained that Albertus Magnus ignorance of the fundamentals of alchemy prevented a complete picture of wisdom While alchemy was not more important to him than any of the other sciences and he did not produce symbolic allegorical works Bacon contributions advanced alchemy connections to soteriology and Christian theology Bacon writings demonstrated an integration of morality salvation alchemy and the prolongation of life His correspondence with Pope Clement IV highlighted this integration calling attention to the importance of alchemy to the papacy Like the Greeks before him Bacon acknowledged the division of alchemy into the practical and theoretical He noted that the theoretical lay outside the scope of Aristotle the natural philosophers and all Latin writers of his time The practical however confirmed the theoretical through experiment and Bacon advocated its uses in natural science and medicine Soon after Bacon the influential work of sometimes identified as Paul of Taranto appeared His Summa Perfectionis remained a staple summary of alchemical practice and theory through the medieval and renaissance periods It was notable for its inclusion of practical chemical operations alongside theory and the unusual clarity with which they were described By the end of the century alchemy had developed into a fairly structured system of belief Adepts believed in the theories of Hermes that is to say they believed that processes that affect minerals and other substances could have an effect on the human body for example if one could learn the secret of purifying gold one could use the technique to purify the human soul They believed in the four elements and the four qualities as described above and they had a strong tradition of cloaking their written ideas in a labyrinth of coded jargon set with traps to mislead the uninitiated Finally the alchemists practiced their art they actively experimented with chemicals and made observations and theories about how the universe operated Their entire philosophy revolved around their belief that man soul was divided within himself after the fall of Adam By purifying the two parts of man soul man could be reunited with God In the century alchemy became more accessible to Europeans outside the confines of Latin speaking churchmen and scholars Alchemical discourse shifted from scholarly philosophical debate to an exposed social commentary on the alchemists themselves Dante Piers the Ploughman and Chaucer all painted unflattering pictures of alchemists as thieves and liars Pope John XXII edict Spondent quas non exhibent forbade the false promises of transmutation made by In Henry IV of England banned the practice of multiplying metals although it was possible to buy a licence to attempt to make gold alchemically and a number were granted by Henry VI and Edward IV These critiques and regulations centered more around charlatanism than the actual study of alchemy which continued with an increasingly Christian tone The century saw the Christian imagery of death and resurrection employed in the alchemical texts of Petrus Bonus John of Rupescissa and in works written in the name of Raymond Lull and Arnold of Villanova Nicolas Flamel is a well known alchemist but a good example of pseudepigraphy the practice of giving your works the name of someone else usually more famous Though the historical Flamel existed the writings and legends assigned to him only appeared in Flamel was not a religious scholar as were many of his predecessors and his entire interest in the subject revolved around the pursuit of the philosopher stone His work spends a great deal of time describing the processes and reactions but never actually gives the formula for carrying out the transmutations Most of his work was aimed at gathering alchemical knowledge that had existed before him especially as regarded the philosopher stone Through the late Middle Ages alchemists were much like Flamel they concentrated on looking for the philosophers stone Bernard Trevisan and George Ripley made similar contributions in the and centuries Their cryptic allusions and symbolism led to wide variations in interpretation of the art Alchemy in the Renaissance and modern age During the Renaissance Hermetic and Platonic foundations were restored to European alchemy The dawn of medical pharmaceutical occult and entrepreneurial branches of alchemy followed Francis Melville in his translation of the Arabic Book of the Composition of Alchemy commented on the Emerald Tablet and the Hermetic texts by stating Here was an ancient body of theological philosophical scientific and medical writings of extraordinary beauty intellectual power and spiritual authority in which Jews Christians and Muslims could find confirmations amplifications and refinements of their own sacred teachings In the late century Marsilo Ficino translated the Corpus Hermeticum and the works of Plato into Latin These were previously unavailable to Europeans who for the first time had a full picture of the alchemical theory that Bacon had declared absent Renaissance Humanism and Renaissance Neoplatonism guided alchemists away from physics to refocus on mankind as the alchemical vessel Esoteric systems developed that blended alchemy into a broader occult Hermeticism fusing it with magic astrology and Christian cabala A key figure in this development was German Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa who received his Hermetic education in Italy in the schools of the humanists In his De Occulta Philosophia he attempted to merge Kabbalah Hermetism and alchemy He was instrumental in spreading this new blend of Hermeticism outside the borders of Italy Philippus Aureolus Paracelsus Theophrastus Bombastus von Hohenheim cast alchemy into a new form rejecting some of Agrippa occultism and moving away from chrysopoeia Paracelsus pioneered the use of chemicals and minerals in medicine and wrote Many have said of Alchemy that it is for the making of gold and silver For me such is not the aim but to consider only what virtue and power may lie in medicines His hermetical views were that sickness and health in the body relied on the harmony of man the microcosm and Nature the macrocosm He took an approach different from those before him using this analogy not in the manner of but in the manner that humans must have certain balances of minerals in their bodies and that certain illnesses of the body had chemical remedies that could cure them Paracelsian practical alchemy especially herbal medicine and plant remedies has since been named spagyrics a synonym for alchemy from the Greek words meaning to separate and to join together based on the Latin alchemic maxim solve et coagula Iatrochemistry also refers to the pharmaceutical applications of alchemy championed by Paracelsus John Dee July December followed Agrippa occult tradition Though better known for angel summoning divination and his role as astrologer cryptographer and consultant to Queen Elizabeth I Dee alchemical Monas Hieroglyphica written in was his most popular and influential work His writing portrayed alchemy as a sort of terrestrial astronomy in line with the Hermetic axiom As above so below Entrepreneurial opportunities were not uncommon for the alchemists of Renaissance Europe Alchemists were contracted by the elite for practical purposes related to mining medical services and the production of chemicals medicines metals and gemstones Rudolf II Holy Roman Emperor in the late century famously received and sponsored various alchemists at his court in Prague including Dee and his associate Edward Kelley King James IV of Scotland Julius Duke of neburg Henry V Duke of neburg Augustus Elector of Saxony Julius Echter von Mespelbrunn and Maurice Landgrave of all contracted alchemists John son Arthur Dee worked as a court physician to Michael I of Russia and Charles I of England but also compiled the alchemical book Fasciculus Chemicus Though most of these appointments were legitimate the trend of fraud continued through the Renaissance Betr ger would use sleight of hand or claims of secret knowledge to make money or secure patronage Legitimate mystical and medical alchemists such as Michael Maier and Heinrich Khunrath wrote about fraudulent transmutations distinguishing themselves from the con artists False alchemists were sometimes prosecuted for fraud The terms chemia and alchemia were used as synonyms in the early modern period and the differences between alchemy chemistry and assaying and metallurgy were not as neat as in the present day There were important overlaps between practitioners and trying to classify them into alchemists chemists and craftsmen is anachronistic For example Tycho Brahe an alchemist better known for his astronomical and astrological investigations had a laboratory built at his Uraniborg institute Michael Sendivogius Micha S dziw j a Polish alchemist philosopher medical doctor and pioneer of chemistry wrote mystical works but is also credited with distilling oxygen in a lab sometime around Sendivogious taught his technique to Cornelius Drebbel who in applied this in a submarine Isaac Newton devoted considerably more of his writing to the study of alchemy see Isaac Newton occult studies than he did to either optics or physics Other early modern alchemists who were eminent in their other studies include Robert Boyle and Jan Baptist van Helmont Their Hermetism complemented rather than precluded their practical achievements in medicine and science The decline of European alchemy The decline of European alchemy was brought about by the rise of modern science with its emphasis on rigorous quantitative experimentation and its disdain for ancient wisdom Although the seeds of these events were planted as early as the century alchemy still flourished for some two hundred years and in fact may have reached its apogee in the century As late as James Price claimed to have produced a powder that could transmute mercury into silver or gold Meanwhile Paracelsian alchemy led to the development of modern medicine Experimentalists gradually uncovered the workings of the human body such as blood circulation Harvey and eventually traced many diseases to infections with germs Koch and Pasteur century or lack of natural nutrients and vitamins Lind Eijkman Funk et Supported by parallel developments in organic chemistry the new science easily displaced alchemy from its medical roles interpretive and prescriptive while deflating its hopes of miraculous elixirs and exposing the ineffectiveness or even toxicity of its remedies During the century a supernatural interpretation of alchemy became popular including support by fellows of the Royal Society Robert Boyle and Elias Ashmole Proponents of the supernatural interpretation of alchemy believed that the philosopher stone might be used to summon and communicate with angels The words alchemy and chemistry were used interchangeably during most of the century only during the century was a distinction drawn rigidly between the two In the century alchemy was considered to be restricted to the realm of gold making leading to the popular belief that most if not all alchemists were charlatans and the tradition itself nothing more than a fraud The obscure and secretive writings of the alchemists was used as a case by those who wished to forward a fraudulent and opinion of alchemy In order to protect the developing science of modern chemistry from the negative censure of which alchemy was being subjected academic writers during the scientific Enlightenment attempted for the sake of survival to separate and divorce the new chemistry from the old practices of alchemy This move was mostly successful and the consequences of this continued into the and centuries and even to the present day Robert Boyle better known for his studies of gases Boyle law pioneered the scientific method in chemical investigations He assumed nothing in his experiments and compiled every piece of relevant data in a typical experiment Boyle would note the place in which the experiment was carried out the wind characteristics the position of the Sun and Moon and the barometer reading all just in case they proved to be relevant This approach eventually led to the founding of modern chemistry in the and centuries based on revolutionary discoveries of Lavoisier and John Dalton which finally provided a logical quantitative and reliable framework for understanding matter transmutations and revealed the futility of longstanding alchemical goals such as the philosopher stone The foregoing developments in alchemy and chymistry from the to the centuries have led many historians of science to argue that Lavoisier work represented less of revolution and more of an simple extension of the theories methods and techniques that had been developed in previous centuries In the words of Matthew Daniel Eddy the Chemical Revolution was a series of sparks that took place over time and not one big explosion that occurred when Lavoisier first published his work During the occult revival of the early century alchemy received new attention as an occult science The esoteric or occultist school which arose during the century held and continues to hold the view that the substances and operations mentioned in alchemical literature are to be interpreted in a spiritual sense and it downplays the role of the alchemy as a practical tradition or protoscience This interpretation further forwarded the view that alchemy is an art primarily concerned with spiritual enlightenment or illumination as opposed to the physical manipulation of apparatus and chemicals and claims that the obscure language of the alchemical texts were an allegorical guise for spiritual moral or mystical processes In the revival of alchemy the two most seminal figures were Mary Anne Atwood and Ethan Allen Hitchcock who independently published similar works regarding spiritual alchemy Both forwarded a completely esoteric view of alchemy as Atwood claimed No modern art or chemistry notwithstanding all its surreptitious claims has any thing in common with Alchemy Atwood work influenced subsequent authors of the occult revival including Eliphas Levi Arthur Edward Waite and Rudolf Steiner Hitchcock in his Remarks Upon Alchymists attempted to make a case for his spiritual interpretation with his claim that the alchemists wrote about a spiritual discipline under a materialistic guise in order to avoid accusations of blasphemy from the church and state In Baron Carl Reichenbach published his studies on Odic force a concept with some similarities to alchemy but his research did not enter the mainstream of scientific discussion Indian alchemy According to the Encyclop dia Britannica the Vedas describe a connection between eternal life and gold The use of Mercury for alchemy is first documented in the century CE Artha stra Buddhist texts from the to centuries CE mention the transmutation of base metals to gold Greek alchemy may have been introduced to Ancient India through the invasions of Alexander the Great in BCE and kingdoms that were culturally influenced by the Greeks like Gandh ra although hard evidence for this is lacking The Persian chemist and physician Ab Rayh n B r n who visited Gujarat as part of the court of Mahmud of Ghazni reported that they The goals of alchemy in India included the creation of a divine body Sanskrit and immortality while still embodied Sanskrit j Sanskrit alchemical texts include much material on the manipulation of mercury and sulphur that are homologized with the semen of the god iva and the menstrual blood of the goddess Dev Some early alchemical writings seem to have their origins in the Kaula tantric schools associated to the teachings of the personality of Matsyendranath Other early writings are found in the Jaina medical treatise Kaly ak rakam of Ugr ditya written in South India in the early century Two famous early Indian alchemical authors were N g rjuna Siddha and Nityan tha Siddha N g rjuna Siddha was a Buddhist monk His book Rasendramangalam is an example of Indian alchemy and medicine Nityan tha Siddha wrote Rasaratn kara also a highly influential work In Sanskrit rasa translates to mercury and N g rjuna Siddha was said to have developed a method of converting mercury into gold Reliable scholarship on Indian alchemy has been advanced in a major way by the publication of The Alchemical Body by David Gordon White Trustworthy scholarship on Indian alchemy must now take the findings of this work into account An important modern bibliography on Indian alchemical studies has also been provided by David Gordon White at Oxford Bibliographies Online Representative works in Sanskrit The contents of the following Sanskrit alchemical treatises have been analysed in detail in Jan Meulenbeld History of Indian Medical Literature The discussion of these works in HIML gives a summary of the contents of each work their special features and where possible the evidence concerning their dating Chapter of HIML Various works on rasa stra and ratna stra or Various works on alchemy and gems gives brief details of a further six hundred and treatises In some cases Meulenbeld gives notes on the contents and authorship of these works in other cases references are made only to the unpublished manuscripts of these titles A great deal remains to be discovered about Indian alchemical literature The content of the Sanskrit alchemical corpus has not yet been adequately integrated into the wider general history of alchemy Chinese alchemy Whereas European alchemy eventually centered on the transmutation of base metals into noble ones Chinese alchemy had a more obvious connection to medicine The philosopher stone of European alchemists can be compared to the Grand Elixir of Immortality sought by Chinese alchemists However in the hermetic view these two goals were not unconnected and the philosopher stone was often equated with the universal panacea therefore the two traditions may have had more in common than initially appears Black powder may have been an important invention of Chinese alchemists As previously stated above Chinese alchemy was more related to medicine It is said that the Chinese invented gunpowder while trying to find a potion for eternal life Described in texts and used in fireworks in China by the century it was used in cannons by From China the use of gunpowder spread to Japan the Mongols the Arab world and Europe Gunpowder was used by the Mongols against the Hungarians in and in Europe by the century Chinese alchemy was closely connected to Taoist forms of traditional Chinese medicine such as Acupuncture and Moxibustion and to martial arts such as Tai Chi Chuan and Kung Fu although some Tai Chi schools believe that their art derives from the philosophical or hygienic branches of Taoism not Alchemical In fact in the early Song Dynasty followers of this Taoist idea chiefly the elite and upper class would ingest mercuric sulfide which though tolerable in low levels led many to suicide Thinking that this consequential death would lead to freedom and access to the Taoist heavens the ensuing deaths encouraged people to eschew this method of alchemy in favor of external sources the aforementioned Tai Chi Chuan mastering of the qi Alchemy as a subject of historical research The history of alchemy has become a significant and recognized subject of academic study As the language of the alchemists is analyzed historians are becoming more aware of the intellectual connections between that discipline and other facets of Western cultural history such as the evolution of science and philosophy the sociology and psychology of the intellectual communities kabbalism spiritualism Rosicrucianism and other mystic movements Institutions involved in this research include The Chymistry of Isaac Newton project at Indiana University the University of Exeter Centre for the Study of Esotericism EXESESO the European Society for the Study of Western Esotericism ESSWE and the University of Amsterdam for the History of Hermetic Philosophy and Related Currents A large collection of books on alchemy is kept in the Bibliotheca Philosophica Hermetica in Amsterdam Journals which publish regularly on the topic of Alchemy include Ambix published by the Society for the History of alchemy and Chemistry and Isis published by The History of Science Society Modern alchemy Due to the complexity and obscurity of alchemical literature and the disappearance of remaining alchemical practitioners into the area of chemistry the general understanding of alchemy has been strongly influenced by several distinct and radically different interpretations Those focusing on the exoteric such as historians of science Lawrence Principe and William Newman have interpreted the decknamen or code words of alchemy as physical substances These practitioners have reconstructed physicochemical experiments that they say are described in medieval and early modern texts At the opposite end of the spectrum esoteric alchemists interpret these same decknamen as spiritual religious or psychological concepts Today new interpretations of alchemy are still perpetuated sometimes merging in concepts from New Age or radical environmentalism movements Groups like the rosicrucians and freemasons have a continued interest in alchemy and its symbolism Alchemy in traditional medicine Traditional medicine sometimes involves the transmutation of natural substances using pharmacological or a combination of pharmacological and spiritual techniques In Ayurveda the samskaras are claimed to transform heavy metals and toxic herbs in a way that removes their toxicity These processes are actively used to the present day Spagyrists of the century Albert Richard Riedel and Jean Dubuis merged Paracelsian alchemy with occultism teaching laboratory pharmaceutical methods The schools they founded Les Philosophes de la Nature and The Paracelsus Research Society popularized modern spagyrics including the manufacture of herbal tinctures and products The courses books organizations and conferences generated by their students continue to influence popular applications of alchemy as a new age medicinal practice Psychology Alchemical symbolism has been used by psychologists such as Carl Jung who reexamined alchemical symbolism and theory and presented the inner meaning of alchemical work as a spiritual path Jung was deeply interested in the occult since his youth participating in seances which he used as the basis for his doctoral dissertation On the Psychology and Pathology of Occult Phenomena In Jung had already adopted a spiritualist and redemptive interpretation of alchemy likely reflecting his interest in the occult literature of the century Jung began writing his views on alchemy from the and continued until the end of his life His interpretation of Chinese alchemical texts in terms of his analytical psychology also served the function of comparing Eastern and Western alchemical imagery and core concepts and hence its possible inner sources archetypes Jung saw alchemy as a Western dedicated to the achievement of individuation In his interpretation alchemy was the vessel by which Gnosticism survived its various purges into the Renaissance a concept also followed by others such as Stephan Hoeller In this sense Jung viewed alchemy as comparable to a Yoga of the East and more adequate to the Western mind than Eastern religions and philosophies The practice of Alchemy seemed to change the mind and spirit of the Alchemist Conversely spontaneous changes on the mind of Western people undergoing any important stage in individuation seems to produce on occasion imagery known to Alchemy and relevant to the person situation Jung did not completely reject the material experiments of the alchemists but he massively downplayed it writing that the transmutation was performed in the mind of the alchemist He claimed the material substances and procedures were only a projection of the alchemists internal state while the real substance to be transformed was the mind itself von Franz a disciple of Jung continued Jung studies on alchemy and its psychological meaning Jung work exercised a great influence on the mainstream perception of alchemy his approach becoming a stock element in many popular texts on the subject to this day Modern scholars are sometimes critical of the Jungian approach to alchemy as overly reflective of occultism Magnum opus The Great Work of Alchemy is often described as a series of four stages represented by colors Relationship to magic Similarities Medieval Europe was primarily an agrarian culture which meant that most aspects of their lives were in direct or indirect response to agriculture Magic alchemy medicine philosophy and religion were all tied together through agriculture A major philosophy that pulled from agrarian life and largely affected alchemy and magic was cosmology Cosmology had ruling over the philosophies of the four elements like for like and ultimately the belief in the essence of things These philosophies makes distinguishing between alchemy and magic difficult blurring the lines and creating huge grey areas where all aspects of medieval life can be mixed at some point Alchemy and Magic are often seen together in the modern world because of blurred lines between them This is because medieval people were Living in a world infused with purpose From ants to cosmic movement things shared a relationship deeper and wider than they do in our modern view It is from the notion of things sharing commonalities that the philosophy of essences came about All of this resulted in magicians philosophers alchemists and physicians to have blurred lines Magic and alchemy especially were interrelated because both were interested in the essences of things or the inner structure of existence operating as the principle of form for each kind of being The essences of things were not simply conceptual entities but to be real and have existence they were regarded as discoverable and even at times transferable as in alchemical operations and in the use of talismans And so alchemy like magic pursed the powers of minerals plants and animals to control nature through those forces that were more powerful than themselves The fundamental notion of exploiting secret powers in nature was part of a common culture that scientists and philosophers shared with practitioners and observers generally Differences Alchemy and magic were distinctive from each other through the terminology of the time that distinguished each aspect of magic and philosophy The modern term magic was broken down into enchantment necromancy conjuration or sorcery but the generic term magic was not common until the century Even though alchemists could have and did participate in any form of magic and even though Magic might accomplish the same effects as prayer or natural techniques its distinguishing feature lay not in its effects but in the causal principle it invoked This is where alchemy is distinguished from magic Magic involves the will of demons or other spiritual forces whereas alchemy focused more on the essences of physical materials Even though both trades worked at times for the same goal and even crossed paths the large distinction was the use or not of supernatural forces Another distinction is in the superstition of the time where a person using the generally unknown properties of some herb was doing magic even though the effect might be perfectly natural in modern terms This meant that many practices were clumped together under the umbrella of magic even though the practices were solely physical Finally it was until the Victorian era that occultists reinterpreted alchemy as a spiritual practice involving the of the practitioner and only incidentally or not at all the transformation of laboratory substances This transition blurred the lines even more between the practices and would give alchemy the negative and cultic connotation that would cause it to fall out of the history of science Convergence Despite the convergence of many aspects of medieval life into alchemy careful contextual readings of alchemical texts now continue to reveal that alchemy was never monolithic or static and that Early modern European alchemy alone displays a staggering diversity of theories practices and purposes Scholastic and Paracelsian and Hermetic Neoplatonic mechanistic vitalistic and more plus virtually every combination and compromise thereof The relationship between alchemy and magic is complex and different from case to case and in each era they were practiced It is easy to conclude then that alchemy and magic were neither completely different nor completely the same at any given time but rather that they have blurred lines between them Symbolism as a Key Symbolism is used in both Magic and Alchemy as a codifier to confuscate powerful and controversial knowledge as a meditation to reveal the meaning of the symbols as talismans of power and to the advanced as a language very similar to that of the psyche It is this aspect which is the fundamental link between Magic and Alchemy These concepts are preserved in the symbols of the Tarot which show astro religious shamanic magical and alchemical symbolism drawn into a single tradition From this symbolic perspective the physical Great Work of transmuting metals in the laboratory is itself a meditation on the symbolic processes inherent nature Alchemy in art and entertainment Alchemy has had a long standing relationship with art seen both in alchemical texts and in mainstream entertainment Literary alchemy appears throughout the history of English literature from Shakespeare to Rowling Here characters or plot structure follow an alchemical magnum opus In the century Chaucer began a trend of alchemical satire that can still be seen in recent fantasy works like those of Terry Pratchett Visual artists had a similar relationship with alchemy While some of them used alchemy as a source of satire others worked with the alchemists themselves or integrated alchemical thought or symbols in their work Music was also present in the works of alchemists and continues to influence popular performers In the last hundred years alchemists have been portrayed in a magical and spagyric role in fantasy fiction film television novels comics and video games
