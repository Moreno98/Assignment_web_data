Affirming the consequent Affirming the consequent sometimes called converse error or fallacy of the converse is a formal fallacy of inferring the converse from the original statement The corresponding argument has the general form An argument of this form is invalid the conclusion can be false even when statements and are true Since P was never asserted as the only sufficient condition for Q other factors could account for Q while P was false To put it differently if P implies Q the only inference that can be made is implies and designate the opposite propositions to P and Q This is known as logical contraposition Symbolically The name affirming the consequent derives from the premise Q which affirms the then clause of the conditional premise Examples One way to demonstrate the invalidity of this argument form is with a counterexample with true premises but an obviously false conclusion For example Owning Fort Knox is not the only way to be rich Any number of other ways exist to be rich However one can affirm with certainty that if Bill Gates is not rich then Bill Gates does not own Fort Knox This is the contrapositive of the first statement and it must be true if the original statement is true Arguments of the same form can sometimes seem superficially convincing as in the following example But having the flu is not the only cause of a sore throat since many illnesses cause sore throat such as the common cold or strep throat
