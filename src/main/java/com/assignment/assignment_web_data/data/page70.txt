Adobe Adobe Arabic is the Spanish word for mud brick a natural building material made from sand clay water and some kind of fibrous or organic material sticks straw manure usually shaped into bricks using molds and dried in the sun Adobe buildings are similar to cob and rammed earth buildings but cob and rammed earth are directly made into walls rather than bricks These bricks were used to make pueblos in New Mexico The Anasazi Hopi and Zuni peoples used this The Romanian name for this material is chirpici Description For a deeper understanding of adobe one might examine a cob building Cob a close cousin to adobe contains proportioned amounts of soil clay water manure and straw This is blended but not formed like adobe Cob is spread and piled over the home frame and allowed to air dry for several months before habitation Adobe then can be described as dried bricks of cob stacked and mortared together with more adobe mixture to create a thick wall roof Strength Adobe structures are extremely durable and account for some of the oldest existing buildings in the world Compared to wooden buildings adobe buildings offer significant advantages due to their greater thermal mass in hot climates but they are known to be particularly susceptible to earthquake damage Cases where adobe structures were widely damaged during earthquakes include the Guatemala earthquake the Bam earthquake and the Chile earthquake Distribution Buildings made of earth are common in West Asia North Africa West Africa South America southwestern North America Spain usually in the Mud jar style Eastern Europe and East Anglia particularly Norfolk known as clay lump Adobe had been in use by indigenous peoples of the Americas in the Southwestern United States Mesoamerica and the Andean region of South America for several thousand years although often substantial amounts of stone are used in the walls of Pueblo buildings Also the Pueblo people built their adobe structures with handfuls or basketfuls of adobe until the Spanish introduced them to making bricks Adobe brickmaking was used in Spain from the Late Bronze Age and Iron Age from the century onwards Its wide use can be attributed to its simplicity of design and manufacture and the economy of creating it A distinction is sometimes made between the smaller adobes which are about the size of ordinary baked bricks and the larger adobines some of which may be one to two yards m long Etymology The word adobe has existed for around years with relatively little change in either pronunciation or meaning The word can be traced from the Middle Egyptian BC word dbt mud brick As Middle Egyptian evolved into Late Egyptian Demotic and finally Coptic BC became tobe brick This was borrowed into Arabic as al tob tuba or Al al the brick brick which was assimilated into Old Spanish as adobe still with the meaning mud brick English borrowed the word from Spanish in the early century In more modern English usage the term adobe has come to include a style of architecture popular in the desert climates of North America especially in New Mexico Compare with stucco Composition An adobe brick is a composite material made of clay mixed with water and an organic material such as straw or dung The soil composition typically contains clay and sand Straw is useful in binding the brick together and allowing the brick to dry evenly thereby preventing cracking due to uneven shrinkage rates through the brick Dung offers the same advantage and is also added to repel insects The most desirable soil texture for producing the mud of adobe is clay silt and fine sand Another source quotes clay and the remainder sand and coarser particles up to cobbles inches with no deleterious effect Modern adobe is stabilized with either emulsified asphalt or Portland cement up to by weight The clay content should be a mixture of no more that half expansive clays with the remainder illite or kaolinite Too much expansive clay results in uneven drying through the brick and cracking while too much kaolinite will make a weak brick Typically the soils of the Southwest United States where such construction is in use are an adequate composition Adobe bricks Bricks are made in an open frame being a reasonable size but any convenient size is acceptable The mixture is molded into a frame and then the frame is removed after initial setting After drying a few hours the bricks are turned on edge to finish drying Slow drying in shade reduces cracking The same mixture used to make bricks but without straw is used for mortar and often for plaster on interior and exterior walls Some ancient cultures used cement for the plaster to protect against rain damage The brick s thickness is preferred partially due to its thermal characteristics and partially due to the stability of a thicker brick versus a more brick Depending on the form into which the mixture is pressed adobe can encompass nearly any shape or size provided drying is even and the mixture includes reinforcement for larger bricks Reinforcement can include manure straw cement rebar or wooden posts Experience has shown straw cement or manure added to a standard adobe mixture can all produce a stronger more brick A general testing is done on the soil content first To do so a sample of the soil is mixed into a clear container with some water creating an almost completely saturated liquid After it is sealed the container is shaken vigorously for at least one minute It is then allowed to sit on a flat surface for a day or so until the soil has settled into layers or remains in suspension Heavier particles settle out first so gravel will be on the bottom sand above silt above that and very fine clay and organic matter will stay in suspension for days After the water has cleared percentages of the various particles can be determined Fifty to percent sand and to percent clay will yield strong bricks The New Mexico State University Extension Service recommends a mix of not more than clay not less than sand and never more than silt Material properties Adobe walls are load bearing they carry their own weight into the foundation rather than by another structure hence the adobe must have sufficient compressive strength In the United States most building codes call for a minimum compressive strength of for the adobe block Adobe construction should be designed so as to avoid lateral structural loads that would cause bending loads The building codes require the building sustain a g lateral acceleration earthquake load Such an acceleration will cause lateral loads on the walls resulting in shear and bending and inducing tensile stresses To withstand such loads the codes typically call for a tensile modulus of rupture strength of at least for the finished block In addition to being an inexpensive material with a small resource cost adobe can serve as a significant heat reservoir due to the thermal properties inherent in the massive walls typical in adobe construction In climates typified by hot days and cool nights the high thermal mass of adobe averages out the high and low temperatures of the day moderating the living space temperature The massive walls require a large and relatively long input of heat from the sun radiation and from the surrounding air convection before they warm through to the interior After the sun sets and the temperature drops the warm wall will then continue to transfer heat to the interior for several hours due to the time lag effect Thus a adobe wall of the appropriate thickness is very effective at controlling inside temperature through the wide daily fluctuations typical of desert climates a factor which has contributed to its longevity as a building material Thermodynamic material properties are sparsely quoted The thermal conductivity of adobe is quoted as having an R value of hr F Btu in and a conductivity of W m K quoted from another source A third source provides the following properties conductivity Btu hr ft F heat capacity Btu lbm F density To determine the total R value of a wall for example multiply by the thickness of the wall From knowledge of the adobe density heat capacity and a diffusivity value the conductivity is found to be k Btu hr ft F or W m K The heat capacity is commonly quoted as cp Btu lbm F or joules kg K The density is or The thermal diffusivity is calculated to be or Adobe wall construction When building an adobe structure the ground should be compressed as the weight of adobe wall is significantly greater than that of a frame house and foundation settling may cause cracking of the wall The footing is dug and compressed once again Footing depth is dug to below the ground frost level and depends on the region The footing and stem wall are commonly and inches respectively much greater than for a frame house due of the weight of the walls Modern construction codes call for the use of reinforcing steel in the footing and stem wall Adobe bricks are laid by course Each course is laid the whole length of the wall overlapping at the corners on a layer of adobe mortar Adobe walls usually never rise above two stories as they are load bearing and have low structural strength When creating window and door openings a lintel is placed on top of the opening to support the bricks above Atop the last courses of brick bond beams made of reinforced concrete or heavy wood beams are laid to provide a horizontal bearing plate for the roof beams and to redistribute lateral earthquake loads to shear walls more able to carry the forces To protect the interior and exterior adobe wall finishes can be applied such as mud plaster whitewash or stucco These finishes protect the adobe wall from water damage but need to be reapplied periodically or the walls can be finished with other nontraditional plasters providing longer protection Bricks made with stabilized adobe generally do not need protection of plasters Adobe roof The traditional adobe roof has been constructed using a mixture of water sand and organic materials The mixture was then formed and pressed into wood forms producing rows of dried earth bricks that would then be laid across a support structure of wood and plastered into place with more adobe Roof materials Depending on the materials available a roof may be assembled using wood or metal beams to create a framework to begin layering adobe bricks Depending on the thickness of the adobe bricks the framework has been preformed using a steel framing and a layering of a metal fencing or wiring over the framework to allow an even load as masses of adobe are spread across the metal fencing like cob and allowed to air dry accordingly This method was demonstrated with an adobe blend heavily impregnated with cement to allow even drying and prevent cracking Traditional adobe roof The more traditional flat adobe roofs are functional only in dry climates that are not exposed to snow loads which would call for a steepled roof Cement may be introduced into the adobe mixture to stabilize and strengthen the composite of mud and organic matter The heaviest wooden beams are called Vigas attach to the wall bond beam Atop the vigas smaller members called latillas are laid and upon those brush is then laid Finally atop that the adobe layer is applied Raising a traditional adobe roof To construct a flat adobe roof beams of wood or metal should be assembled and span the extent of the building The ends of the beams are attach to the tops of the walls Taking into account the material from which the beams and walls are made choosing the attachments may prove difficult A combination of the bricks and adobe mortar that are laid across the beams creates an even pressure that can last for many years depending on attrition Once the vigas latillas and brush are laid adobe bricks are placed An adobe roof is often laid with bricks slightly larger in width to ensure a greater expanse is covered when placing the bricks onto the roof Following each individual brick should be a layer of adobe mortar recommended to be at least an inch thick to make certain there is ample strength between the brick s edges and also to provide a relative moisture barrier during rain Attributes Depending on the materials adobe roofs can be inherently The construction of a chimney can greatly influence the construction of the roof supports creating an extra need for care in choosing the materials The builders can make an adobe chimney by stacking simple adobe bricks in a similar fashion as the surrounding walls Adobe around the world The largest structure ever made from adobe bricks was the Bam Citadel which suffered serious damage up to by an earthquake on December Other large adobe structures are the Huaca del Sol in Peru with million signed bricks the ciudellas of Chan Chan and Tambo Colorado both in Peru in South America
