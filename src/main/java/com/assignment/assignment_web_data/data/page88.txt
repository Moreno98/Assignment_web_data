Alberta Alberta is a western province of Canada With a population of in and an estimated population of as of October it is Canada populous province and most populous of Canada three prairie provinces Alberta and its neighbour Saskatchewan were established as provinces on September The current Premier of the province is Jim Prentice It is bounded by the provinces of British Columbia to the west and Saskatchewan to the east the Northwest Territories to the north and the state of Montana to the south Alberta is one of three Canadian provinces and territories to border only a single state and is also one of only two provinces that are landlocked Edmonton the capital city of Alberta is located near the geographic centre of the province and is the primary supply and service hub for Canada crude oil oil sands Athabasca oil sands and other northern resource industries Approximately south of the capital is Calgary Alberta largest city Calgary and Edmonton centre Alberta two census metropolitan areas both of which have populations exceeding one million while the province has census agglomerations Notable tourist destinations in the province include Banff Canmore Drumheller Jasper and Sylvan Lake Etymology Alberta is named after Princess Louise Caroline Alberta the fourth daughter of Victoria the Queen of Canada and Albert Prince Consort Princess Louise was the wife of the Marquess of Lorne Governor General of Canada from to Lake Louise and Mount Alberta were also named in honour of Princess Louise Geography Alberta with an area of is the fourth largest province after Quebec Ontario and British Columbia To the south the province borders on the parallel north separating it from the state of Montana while on the north the parallel north divides it from the Northwest Territories To the east the meridian west separates it from the province of Saskatchewan while on the west its boundary with British Columbia follows the meridian west south from the Northwest Territories at N until it reaches the Continental Divide at the Rocky Mountains and from that point follows the line of peaks marking the Continental Divide in a generally southeasterly direction until it reaches the Montana border at N The province extends north to south and east to west at its maximum width Its highest point is at the summit of Mount Columbia in the Rocky Mountains along the southwest border while its lowest point is on the Slave River in Wood Buffalo National Park in the northeast With the exception of the steppe of the southeastern section the province has adequate water resources There are numerous rivers and lakes used for swimming fishing and a range of water sports There are three large lakes Lake Claire in Wood Buffalo National Park Lesser Slave Lake and Lake Athabasca which lies in both Alberta and Saskatchewan The longest river in the province is the Athabasca River which travels from the Columbia Icefield in the Rocky Mountains to Lake Athabasca The largest river is the Peace River with an average flow of The Peace River originates in the Rocky Mountains of northern British Columbia and flows through northern Alberta and into the Slave River a tributary of the Mackenzie River Alberta capital city Edmonton is located approximately in the geographic centre of the province It is the most northerly major city in Canada and serves as a gateway and hub for resource development in northern Canada The region with its proximity to Canada largest oil fields has most of western Canada oil refinery capacity Calgary is located approximately south of Edmonton and north of Montana surrounded by extensive ranching country Almost of the province population lives in the Calgary Edmonton Corridor The land grant policy to the railroads served as a means to populate the province in its early years Most of the northern half of the province is boreal forest while the Rocky Mountains along the southwestern boundary are largely forested see Alberta Mountain forests and Columbia foothills forests The southern quarter of the province is prairie ranging from shortgrass prairie in the southeastern corner to mixed grass prairie in an arc to the west and north of it The central aspen parkland region extending in a broad arc between the prairies and the forests from Calgary north to Edmonton and then east to Lloydminster contains the most fertile soil in the province and most of the population Much of the unforested part of Alberta is given over either to grain or to dairy farming with mixed farming more common in the north and centre while ranching and irrigated agriculture predominate in the south The Alberta badlands are located in southeastern Alberta where the Red Deer River crosses the flat prairie and farmland and features deep canyons and striking landforms Dinosaur Provincial Park near Brooks Alberta showcases the badlands terrain desert flora and remnants from Alberta past when dinosaurs roamed the then lush landscape Climate Alberta has a dry continental climate with warm summers and cold winters The province is open to cold arctic weather systems from the north which often produce extremely cold conditions in winter As the fronts between the air masses shift north and south across Alberta the temperature can change rapidly Arctic air masses in the winter produce extreme minimum temperatures varying from in northern Alberta to in southern Alberta In the summer continental air masses produce maximum temperatures from in the mountains to in southern Alberta Alberta extends for over from north to south its climate therefore varies considerably Average high temperatures in January range from in the southwest to in the far north The climate is also influenced by the presence of the Rocky Mountains to the southwest which disrupt the flow of the prevailing westerly winds and causes them to drop most of their moisture on the western slopes of the mountain ranges before reaching the province casting a rain shadow over much of Alberta The northerly location and isolation from the weather systems of the Pacific Ocean cause Alberta to have a dry climate with little moderation from the ocean Annual precipitation ranges from in the southeast to in the north except in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains where total precipitation including snowfall can reach annually The province is the namesake of the Alberta clipper a type of intense winter storm that generally forms over or near the province and pushed with great speed by the continental polar jetstream descends over the rest of Southern Canada and the northern tier of the United States In the summer the average daytime temperatures range from around in the Rocky Mountain valleys and far north up to around in the dry prairie of the southeast The northern and western parts of the province experience higher rainfall and lower evaporation rates caused by cooler summer temperatures The south and portions are prone to conditions sometimes persisting for several years although even these areas can receive heavy precipitation and sometimes resulting in flooding Alberta is a sunny province Annual bright sunshine totals range between up to just under hours per year Northern Alberta gets about hours of daylight in the summer In southwestern Alberta the cold winters are frequently interrupted by warm dry chinook winds blowing from the mountains which can propel temperatures upward from frigid conditions to well above the freezing point in a very short period During one chinook recorded at Pincher Creek temperatures soared from in just one hour The region around Lethbridge has the most chinooks averaging to chinook days per year Calgary has a chance of a white Christmas while Edmonton has an chance Northern Alberta is mostly covered by boreal forest and has a subarctic climate The agricultural area of southern Alberta have a steppe climate because the annual precipitation is less than the water that evaporates or is used by plants The southeastern corner of Alberta part of the Palliser Triangle experiences greater summer heat and lower rainfall than the rest of the province and as a result suffers frequent crop yield problems and occasional severe droughts Western Alberta is protected by the mountains and enjoys the mild temperatures brought by winter chinook winds Central and parts of northwestern Alberta in the Peace River region are largely aspen parkland a biome transitional between prairie to the south and boreal forest to the north After Saskatchewan Alberta experiences the most tornadoes in Canada with an average of verified per year Thunderstorms some of them severe are frequent in the summer especially in central and southern Alberta The region surrounding the Calgary Edmonton Corridor is notable for having the highest frequency of hail in Canada which is caused by orographic lifting from the nearby Rocky Mountains enhancing the cycle necessary for the formation of hail Ecology Flora In central and northern Alberta the arrival of spring is marked by the early flowering of the prairie crocus anemone this member of the buttercup family has been recorded flowering as early as March though April is the usual month for the general population Other prairie flora known to flower early are the golden bean and wild rose Members of the sunflower family blossom on the prairie in the summer months between July and September The southern and east central parts of Alberta are covered by short prairie grass which dries up as summer lengthens to be replaced by hardy perennials such as the prairie coneflower fleabane and sage Both yellow and white sweet clover can be found throughout the southern and central areas of the province The trees in the parkland region of the province grow in clumps and belts on the hillsides These are largely deciduous typically aspen poplar and willow Many species of willow and other shrubs grow in virtually any terrain On the north side of the North Saskatchewan River evergreen forests prevail for thousands of square kilometres Aspen poplar balsam poplar or cottonwood and paper birch are the primary large deciduous species Conifers include Jack pine Rocky Mountain pine Lodgepole pine both white and black spruce and the deciduous conifer tamarack Fauna The four climatic regions alpine boreal forest parkland and prairie of Alberta are home to many different species of animals The south and central prairie was the land of the bison commonly known as buffalo its grasses providing pasture and breeding ground for millions of buffalo The buffalo population was decimated during early settlement but since then buffalo have made a comeback living on farms and in parks all over Alberta Alberta is home to many large carnivores Among them are the grizzly and black bears which are found in the mountains and wooded regions Smaller carnivores of the canine and feline families include coyotes wolves fox lynx bobcat and mountain lion cougar Herbivorous animals are found throughout the province Moose mule deer elk and deer are found in the wooded regions and pronghorn can be found in the prairies of southern Alberta Bighorn sheep and mountain goats live in the Rocky Mountains Rabbits porcupines skunks squirrels and many species of rodents and reptiles live in every corner of the province Alberta is home to only one variety of venomous snake the prairie rattlesnake Alberta is the only province in Canada as well as one of the few places in the world that is free of Norwegian rats Since the early the Government of Alberta has operated a program which has been so successful that only isolated instances of wild rat sightings are reported usually of rats arriving in the province aboard trucks or by rail In Alberta Agriculture reported zero findings of wild rats the only rat interceptions have been domesticated rats that have been seized from their owners It is illegal for individual Albertans to own or keep Norwegian rats of any description the animals can only be kept in the province by zoos universities and colleges and recognized research institutions In several rats were found and captured in small pockets in southern Alberta putting Alberta status in jeopardy A colony of rats were subsequently found in a landfill near Medicine Hat in and again in Paleontology Alberta has one of the greatest diversities and abundances of Late Cretaceous dinosaur fossils in the world Taxa are represented by complete fossil skeletons isolated material microvertebrate remains and even mass graves At least dinosaur type specimens were collected in the province The Foremost Formation Oldman Formation and Dinosaur Park Formations collectively comprise the Judith River Group and are the most thoroughly studied strata in Alberta strata are distributed widely throughout Alberta The Dinosaur Provincial Park area contains outcrops of the Dinosaur Park Formation and Oldman Formation In the central and southern regions of Alberta are intermittent Scollard Formation outcrops In the Drumheller Valley and Edmonton regions there are exposed Horseshoe Canyon facies Other formations have been recorded as well like the Milk River and Foremost Formations However these latter two have a lower diversity of documented dinosaurs primarily due to their lower total fossil quantity and neglect from collectors who are hindered by the isolation and scarcity of exposed outcrops Their dinosaur fossils are primarily teeth recovered from microvertebrate fossil sites Additional geologic formations that have produced only few fossils are the Belly River Group and Mary River Formations of the southwest and the northwestern Wapiti Formation The Wapiti Formations contains two Pachyrhinosaurus bone beds that break its general trend of low productivity however The Bearpaw Formation represents strata deposited during a marine transgression Dinosaurs are known from this Formation but represent specimens washed out to sea or reworked from older sediments History arrived in Alberta at least years ago toward the end of the last ice age They are thought to have migrated from Siberia to Alaska on a land bridge across the Bering Strait and then may have moved down the east side of the Rocky Mountains through Alberta to settle the Americas Others may have migrated down the coast of British Columbia and then moved inland Over time they differentiated into various First Nations peoples including the Plains Indian tribes of southern Alberta such as those of the Blackfoot Confederacy and the Plains Cree who generally lived by hunting buffalo American bison and the more northerly tribes such as the Woodland Cree and Chipewyan who hunted trapped and fished for a living After the British arrival in Canada approximately half of the province of Alberta south of the Athabasca River drainage became part of Rupert Land which consisted of all land drained by rivers flowing into Hudson Bay This area was granted by Charles II of England to the Hudson Bay Company HBC in and rival fur trading companies were not allowed to trade in it After the arrival of French Canadians in the west around they settled near fur trading posts establishing communities such as Lac La Biche and Bonnyville Fort La Jonqui re was established near what is now Calgary in The Athabasca River and the rivers north of it were not in HBC territory because they drained into the Arctic Ocean instead of Hudson Bay and they were prime habitat for animals The first explorer of the Athabasca region was Peter Pond who learned of the Methye Portage which allowed travel from southern rivers into the rivers north of Rupert Land Fur traders formed the North West Company NWC of Montreal to compete with the HBC in The NWC occupied the northern part of Alberta territory Peter Pond built Fort Athabasca on Lac la Biche in Roderick Mackenzie built Fort Chipewyan on Lake Athabasca ten years later in His cousin Sir Alexander Mackenzie followed the North Saskatchewan River to its northernmost point near Edmonton then setting northward on foot trekked to the Athabasca River which he followed to Lake Athabasca It was there he discovered the mighty outflow river which bears his name the Mackenzie River which he followed to its outlet in the Arctic Ocean Returning to Lake Athabasca he followed the Peace River upstream eventually reaching the Pacific Ocean and so he became the first European to cross the North American continent north of Mexico The extreme southernmost portion of Alberta was part of the French and Spanish territory of Louisiana sold to the United States in in the portion of Louisiana north of the Parallel was ceded to Great Britain Fur trade expanded in the north but bloody battles occurred between the rival HBC and NWC and in the British government forced them to merge to stop the hostilities The amalgamated Hudson Bay Company dominated trade in Alberta until when the newly formed Canadian Government purchased Rupert Land Northern Alberta was included in the Territory until when it and Rupert land became Canada Northwest Territories The District of Alberta was created as part of the Territories in As settlement increased local representatives to the Legislative Assembly were added After a long campaign for autonomy in the District of Alberta was enlarged and given provincial status with the election of Alexander Cameron Rutherford as the first premier On June during the Alberta floods Alberta experienced heavy rainfall that triggered catastrophic flooding throughout much of the southern half of the province along the Bow Elbow Highwood and Oldman rivers and tributaries A dozen municipalities in Southern Alberta declared local states of emergency on June as water levels rose and numerous communities were placed under evacuation orders Demographics In the census Alberta had a population of living in of its total dwellings a change from its population of With a land area of it had a population density of in In Statistics Canada estimated the province population to be Alberta has experienced a relatively high rate of growth in recent years mainly because of its burgeoning economy Between and the province had high birthrates on par with some larger provinces such as British Columbia relatively high immigration and a high rate of interprovincial migration when compared to other provinces Approximately of the population live in urban areas and only about live in rural areas The Corridor is the most urbanized area in the province and is one of the most densely populated areas of Canada Many of Alberta cities and towns have also experienced very high rates of growth in recent history Over the past century Alberta population rose from in to in and according to the census The census found that English with native speakers was the most common mother tongue of Albertans representing of the province population The next most common mother tongues were various Chinese languages with native speakers followed by German with native speakers and French with Other mother tongues in decreasing order include Punjabi with native speakers Tagalog with Ukrainian with Spanish with Polish with Arabic with Dutch with and Vietnamese with The most common aboriginal language is Cree Other common mother tongues include Italian with speakers Urdu with and Korean with then Hindi Persian Portuguese and Hungarian Figures shown are for the number of single language responses and the percentage of total responses Alberta has considerable ethnic diversity In line with the rest of Canada many immigrants originated from England Scotland Ireland and Wales but large numbers also came from other parts of Europe notably Germany France Ukraine and Scandinavia According to Statistics Canada Alberta is home to the second highest proportion two percent of Francophones in western Canada after Manitoba Despite this relatively few Albertans claim French as their mother tongue Many of Alberta residents live in the central and northwestern regions of the province As reported in the census the Chinese represented nearly four percent of Alberta population and East Indians represented more than two percent Both Edmonton and Calgary have historic Chinatowns and Calgary has Canada third largest Chinese community The Chinese presence began with workers employed in the building of the Canadian Pacific Railway in the Aboriginal Albertans make up approximately three percent of the population In the Canadian census the most commonly reported ethnic origins among Albertans were English German Canadian Scottish Irish French Ukrainian Dutch Polish North American Indian Norwegian and Chinese Each person could choose as many ethnicities as were applicable Amongst those of British origins the Scots have had a particularly strong influence on with the names of many cities and towns including Calgary Airdrie Canmore and Banff having Scottish origins Alberta is the third most diverse province in terms of visible minorities after British Columbia and Ontario with of the population consisting of visible minorities Nearly of the populations of Calgary and Edmonton belong to a visible minority group Aboriginal Identity Peoples make up of the population about half of whom consist of North American Indians and the other half are Metis There are also small number of Inuit people in Alberta The number of Aboriginal Identity Peoples have been increasing at a rate greater than the population of Alberta As of the National Household Survey the largest religious group was Roman Catholic representing of the population Alberta had the second highest percentage of residents among the provinces after British Columbia at of the population Of the remainder of the population identified themselves as belonging to the United Church of Canada while were Anglican Lutherans made up of the population while Baptists comprised The remainder belonged to a wide variety of different religious affiliations none of which constituted more than of the population The LDS Church of Alberta reside primarily in the extreme south of the province Alberta has a population of Hutterites a communal Anabaptist sect similar to the Mennonites and has a significant population of Adventists Alberta is home to several Byzantine Rite Churches as part of the legacy of Eastern European immigration including the Ukrainian Catholic Eparchy of Edmonton and the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Canada Western Diocese which is based in Edmonton Muslims Sikhs Buddhists and Hindus live in Alberta Muslims made up of the population Sikhs Buddhists and Hindus Many of these are recent immigrants but others have roots that go back to the first settlers of the prairies Canada oldest mosque the Mosque is located in Edmonton whereas Calgary is home to Canada largest mosque the Baitun Nur mosque Jews constituted of Alberta population Most of Alberta Jews live in Calgary and Edmonton Economy Alberta economy is one of the strongest in Canada supported by the burgeoning petroleum industry and to a lesser extent agriculture and technology The per capita GDP in was by far the highest of any province in Canada at This was higher than the national average of and more than twice that of some of the Atlantic provinces In the deviation from the national average was the largest for any province in Canadian history According to the census the median annual family income after taxes was in Alberta compared to in Canada as a whole The Corridor is the most urbanized region in the province and one of the densest in Canada The region covers a distance of roughly kilometres north to south In the population of the Corridor was million of Alberta population It is also one of the fastest growing regions in the country A study by TD Bank Financial Group found the corridor to be the only Canadian urban centre to amass a level of wealth while maintaining a Canadian style quality of life offering universal health care benefits The study found that GDP per capita in the corridor was above average metropolitan areas and above other Canadian cities at that time The Fraser Institute states that Alberta also has very high levels of economic freedom and rates Alberta as the freest economy in Canada and the second freest economy amongst states and Canadian provinces The government of Alberta has invested its earnings wisely as of September official statistics reported nearly holdings Industry Alberta is the largest producer of conventional crude oil synthetic crude natural gas and gas products in Canada Alberta is the world s second largest exporter of natural gas and the fourth largest producer Two of the largest producers of petrochemicals in North America are located in central and Alberta In both Red Deer and Edmonton polyethylene and vinyl manufacturers produce products that are shipped all over the world Edmonton oil refineries provide the raw materials for a large petrochemical industry to the east of Edmonton Edmonton also produces a large amount of recycled petrochemical products as well as renewable plastics made from Maize Together the metropolitan areas of both Edmonton and Red Deer produce nearly of the world plastic and renewable plastic materials Edmonton Calgary are industry hotspots for retail chains and entertainment centers with both cities having the most successful movie theaters car dealerships and clothing outlets in all of Canada The two cities are also home to multiple headquarters and major head offices of corporations and are home to at least business headquarters of the Fortune according to Forbes with a planned total of by The Athabasca oil sands surrounding Fort McMurray have estimated unconventional oil reserves approximately equal to the conventional oil reserves of the rest of the world estimated to be trillion barrels Many companies employ both conventional strip mining and in situ methods to extract the bitumen from the oil sands As of late there were over billion in oil sands projects under construction or in the planning stages in northeastern Alberta Another factor determining the viability of oil extraction from the oil sands is the price of oil The oil price increases since have made it profitable to extract this oil which in the past would give little profit or even a loss By however rising costs and stabilizing oil prices were threatening the economic viability of some projects An example of this was the shelving of the Joslyn north project in the Athabasca region in May With concerted effort and support from the provincial government several industries have found their birth in Alberta notably patents related to interactive liquid crystal display systems The Government of Alberta and the City of Edmonton also hold patent rights to OLED displays after organic LED experiments at the University of Alberta proved successful With a growing economy Alberta has several financial institutions dealing with civil and private funds Agriculture and forestry Agriculture has a significant position in the province economy The province has over three million head of cattle and Alberta beef has a healthy worldwide market Nearly one half of all Canadian beef is produced in Alberta Alberta is one of the top producers of plains buffalo bison for the consumer market Sheep for wool and mutton are also raised Wheat and canola are primary farm crops with Alberta leading the provinces in spring wheat production other grains are also prominent Much of the farming is dryland farming often with fallow seasons interspersed with cultivation Continuous cropping in which there is no fallow season is gradually becoming a more common mode of production because of increased profits and a reduction of soil erosion Across the province the once common grain elevator is slowly being lost as rail lines are decreasing farmers typically truck the grain to central points Alberta is the leading beekeeping province of Canada with some beekeepers wintering hives indoors in specially designed barns in southern Alberta then migrating north during the summer into the Peace River valley where the season is short but the working days are long for honeybees to produce honey from clover and fireweed Hybrid canola also requires bee pollination and some beekeepers service this need The vast northern forest reserves of softwood allow Alberta to produce large quantities of lumber oriented strand board OSB and plywood and several plants in northern Alberta supply North America and the Pacific Rim nations with bleached wood pulp and newsprint Tourism Alberta has been a tourist destination from the early days of the twentieth century with attractions including outdoor locales for skiing hiking and camping shopping locales such as West Edmonton Mall Calgary Stampede outdoor festivals professional athletic events international sporting competitions such as the Commonwealth Games and Olympic Games as well as more eclectic attractions There are also natural attractions like Elk Island National Park Wood Buffalo National Park and the Columbia Icefield According to Alberta Economic Development Calgary and Edmonton both host over four million visitors annually Banff Jasper and the Rocky Mountains are visited by about three million people per year Alberta tourism relies heavily on Southern Ontario tourists as well as tourists from other parts of Canada the United States and many international countries Alberta Rocky Mountains include tourist destinations Banff National Park and Jasper National Park The two mountain parks are connected by the scenic Icefields Parkway Banff is located west of Calgary on Highway and Jasper is located west of Edmonton on Yellowhead Highway Five of Canada fourteen UNESCO World heritage sites are located within the province Canadian Rocky Mountain Parks International Peace Park Wood Buffalo National Park Dinosaur Provincial Park and Buffalo Jump About million people visit the of Calgary Stampede a celebration of Canada own Wild West and the cattle ranching industry About people enjoy Edmonton formerly Klondike Days and Capital EX Edmonton was the gateway to the only route to the Yukon gold fields and the only route which did not require to travel the exhausting and dangerous Chilkoot Pass Another tourist destination that draws more than visitors each year is the Drumheller Valley located northeast of Calgary Drumheller Dinosaur Capital of The World offers the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology Drumheller also had a rich mining history being one of Western Canada largest coal producers during the war years Located in Alberta is Alberta Prairie Railway Excursions a popular tourist attraction operated out of Stettler that offers train excursions into the prairie and caters to tens of thousands of visitors every year Alberta has numerous ski resorts most notably Sunshine Village Lake Louise Marmot Basin Norquay and Nakiska Government and politics The Government of Alberta is organized as a parliamentary democracy with a unicameral legislature Its unicameral legislature the Legislative Assembly consists of members elected first past the post FPTP from constituencies Locally municipal governments and school boards are elected and operate separately Their boundaries do not necessarily coincide Municipalities where the same body act as both local government and school board are formally referred to as counties in Alberta As Canada head of state Queen Elizabeth II is the head of state for the Government of Alberta Her duties in Alberta are carried out by Lieutenant Governor Donald Ethell The Queen and lieutenant governor are figureheads whose actions are highly restricted by custom and constitutional convention The lieutenant governor handles numerous honourific duties in the name of the Queen The government is headed by the premier The current premier is Jim Prentice who became the leader of the governing Progressive Conservatives on September Prentice was sworn in as the Premier of Alberta on September The premier is normally a member of the Legislative Assembly and he draws all the members of his Cabinet from among the members of the Legislative Assembly The City of Edmonton is the seat of the provincial government the capital of Alberta Alberta elections tend to yield results which are much more conservative than those of other Canadian provinces Alberta has traditionally had three political parties the Progressive Conservatives Conservatives or Tories the Liberals and the social democratic New Democrats A fourth party the strongly conservative Social Credit Party was a power in Alberta for many decades but fell from the political map after the Progressive Conservatives came to power in Since that time no other political party has governed Alberta Only four parties have governed Alberta the Liberals from to the United Farmers of Alberta from to the Social Credit Party from to and the currently governing Progressive Conservative Party from to the present Alberta has had occasional surges in separatist sentiment Even during the when these feelings were at their strongest there has never been enough interest in secession to initiate any major movements or referendums There are several currently active groups wishing to promote the independence of Alberta in some form Taxation Government revenue comes mainly from royalties on natural resources personal income taxes corporate and other taxes and grants from the federal government primarily for infrastructure projects Albertans are the people in Canada and Alberta is the only province in Canada without a provincial sales tax but residents are still subject to the federal sales tax the Goods and Services Tax of It is also the only Canadian province to have a flat tax for personal income taxes which is of taxable income The Alberta personal income tax system maintains a progressive character by granting residents personal tax exemptions of in addition to a variety of tax deductions for persons with disabilities students and the aged Alberta municipalities and school jurisdictions have their own governments who usually work in with the provincial government Alberta also privatized alcohol distribution The privatization increased outlets from stores to jobs to jobs and products to products Tax revenue also increased from million to million Albertan municipalities raise a significant portion of their income through levying property taxes The value of assessed property in Alberta was approximately billion in Most real property is assessed according to its market value The exceptions to market value assessment are farmland railways machinery equipment and linear property all of which is assessed by regulated rates Depending on the property type property owners may appeal a property assessment to their municipal Local Assessment Review Board Composite Assessment Review Board or the Alberta Municipal Government Board Military Military bases in Alberta include Canadian Forces Base CFB Cold Lake CFB Edmonton CFB Suffield and CFB Wainwright Air force units stationed at CFB Cold Lake have access to the Cold Lake Air Weapons Range CFB Edmonton is the headquarters for the Canadian Division CFB Suffield hosts British troops and is the largest training facility in Canada Transportation Alberta has over of highways and roads of which nearly are paved The main corridor is Highway which begins south of Cardston at the Carway border crossing and is part of the CANAMEX Corridor Highway which effectively extends Interstate into Alberta and is the busiest gateway to the province begins at the Coutts border crossing and ends at Lethbridge Highway joins Lethbridge to Fort Macleod and links Highway to Highway Highway travels northward through Fort Macleod Calgary Red Deer and Edmonton North of Edmonton the highway continues to Athabasca then northwesterly along the south shore of Lesser Slave Lake into High Prairie north to Peace River west to Fairview and finally south to Grande Prairie where it ends at an interchange with Highway The section of Highway between Calgary and Edmonton has been named the Queen Elizabeth II Highway to commemorate the visit of the monarch in Highway is supplemented by two more highways that run parallel to it Highway west of Highway known as Cowboy Trail and Highway east of Highway Highway travels northwest into Grande Prairie and the Peace River Country Highway travels northeast to Fort McMurray the location of the Athabasca oil sands Alberta has two main corridors The southern corridor part of the Highway system enters the province near Medicine Hat runs westward through Calgary and leaves Alberta through Banff National Park The northern corridor also part of the network and known as the Yellowhead Highway Highway runs west from Lloydminster in eastern Alberta through Edmonton and Jasper National Park into British Columbia One of the most scenic drives is along the Icefields Parkway which runs for between Jasper and Lake Louise with mountain ranges and glaciers on either side of its entire length Another major corridor through central Alberta is Highway also known as the David Thompson Highway which runs east from the Saskatchewan River Crossing in Banff National Park through Rocky Mountain House and Red Deer connecting with Highway west of Stettler The highway connects many of the smaller towns in central Alberta with Calgary and Edmonton as it crosses Highway just west of Red Deer Urban stretches of Alberta major highways and freeways are often called trails For example Highway the main highway in the province is called Deerfoot Trail as it passes through Calgary but becomes Calgary Trail for southbound traffic and Gateway Boulevard for northbound traffic as it enters Edmonton and then turns into Albert Trail as it leaves Edmonton for the City of Albert Calgary in particular has a tradition of calling its largest urban expressways trails and naming many of them after prominent First Nations individuals and tribes such as Crowchild Trail Deerfoot Trail and Stoney Trail Calgary Edmonton Red Deer Medicine Hat and Lethbridge have substantial public transit systems In addition to buses Calgary and Edmonton operate light rail transit LRT systems Edmonton LRT which is underground in the downtown core and on the surface outside the CBD was the first of the modern generation of light rail systems to be built in North America while the Calgary has one of the highest number of daily riders of any LRT system in North America Alberta is by air with international airports in both Calgary and Edmonton Calgary International Airport and Edmonton International Airport are the third and fifth busiest in Canada respectively Calgary airport is a hub for WestJet Airlines and a regional hub for Air Canada Calgary airport primarily serves the Canadian prairie provinces Alberta Saskatchewan and Manitoba for connecting flights to British Columbia eastern Canada major US centres nine European airports one Asian airport and four destinations in Mexico and the Caribbean Edmonton airport acts as a hub for the Canadian north and has connections to all major Canadian airports as well as major US airports European airports and Mexican and Caribbean airports There are more than of operating mainline railway the Canadian Pacific Railway and Canadian National Railway companies operate railway freight across the province Passenger trains include Via Rail Canadian or Rupert trains which use the CN mainline and pass through Jasper National Park and parallel the Yellowhead Highway during at least part of their routes The Rocky Mountaineer operates two sections one from Vancouver to Banff and Calgary over CP tracks and a section that travels over CN tracks to Jasper Health care Alberta provides a publicly funded health care system Alberta Health Services for all its residents as set out by the provisions of the Canada Health Act of Alberta became Canada second province after Saskatchewan to adopt a Tommy Douglas style program in a precursor to the modern medicare system Alberta research institutions and hospitals give AHS the title of hospital centres in the world for Edmonton and Calgary and research institution referring to the University of Alberta health campus Alberta budget was billion during the fiscal year approximately of all government spending making it the best funded health care system in Canada Every hour more than million was spent on health care in the province in In this went up to million an hour totalling billion when both private donations and government spending are accounted for Per person in Alberta was spent on in the sector Notable health education research and resources facilities in Alberta all of which are located within Calgary or Edmonton The Edmonton Clinic complex completed in provides a similar research education and care environment as the Mayo Clinic in the United States All public services funded by the government of Alberta are delivered operationally by Alberta Health Services AHS is the province single health authority established on July which replaced nine local health authorities AHS also funds all ground ambulance services in the province as well as the STARS Shock Trauma Air Rescue Society air ambulance service Education As with any Canadian province the Alberta Legislature has almost exclusive authority to make laws respecting education Since the Legislature has used this capacity to continue the model of locally elected public and separate school boards which originated prior to as well as to create regulate universities colleges technical institutions and other educational forms and institutions public charter schools private schools home schooling Elementary schools There are public school jurisdictions in Alberta and seventeen operating separate school jurisdictions Sixteen of the operating separate school jurisdictions have a Catholic electorate and one Albert has a Protestant electorate In addition one Protestant separate school district Glen Avon survives as a ward of the Paul Education Region The City of Lloydminster straddles the border and both the public and separate school systems in that city are counted in the above numbers both of them operate according to Saskatchewan law For many years the provincial government has funded the greater part of the cost of providing K education Prior to public and separate school boards in Alberta had the legislative authority to levy a local tax on property as a supplementary support for local education In the government of the province eliminated this right for public school boards but not for separate school boards Since there has continued to be a tax on property in support of K education the difference is that the mill rate is now set by the provincial government the money is collected by the local municipal authority and remitted to the provincial government The relevant legislation requires that all the money raised by this property tax must go to the support of K education provided by school boards The provincial government pools the property tax funds from across the province and distributes them according to a formula to public and separate school jurisdictions and Francophone authorities Public and separate school boards charter schools and private schools all follow the Program of Studies and the curriculum approved by the provincial department of education Alberta Education Homeschool tutors may choose to follow the Program of Studies or develop their own Program of Studies Public and separate schools charter schools and approved private schools all employ teachers who are certificated by Alberta Education they administer Provincial Achievement Tests and Diploma Examinations set by Alberta Education and they may grant high school graduation certificates endorsed by Alberta Education Universities The University of Alberta located in Edmonton and established in is Alberta oldest and largest university The University of Calgary once affiliated with the University of Alberta gained its autonomy in and is now the second largest university in Alberta Athabasca University which focuses on distance learning and the University of Lethbridge are located in Athabasca and Lethbridge respectively In early September Mount Royal University became Calgary second public university and in late September a similar move made MacEwan University Edmonton second public university There are colleges that receive direct public funding along with two technical institutes Northern Alberta Institute of Technology and Southern Alberta Institute of Technology There is also a large and active private sector of institutions mostly Christian Universities bringing the total number of universities to twelve plus a DeVry University in Calgary the only location in Canada Students may also receive government loans and grants while attending selected private institutions There has been some controversy in recent years over the rising cost of education for students as opposed to taxpayers In Premier Ralph Klein made a promise that he would freeze tuition and look into ways of reducing schooling costs So far no plan has been released by the Government of Alberta Culture Summer brings many festivals to the province of Alberta especially in Edmonton The Edmonton Fringe Festival is the world second largest after the Edinburgh Festival Both Calgary and Edmonton host a number of annual festivals and events including folk music festivals The city heritage days festival sees the participation of over ethnic groups Edmonton Churchill Square is home to a large number of the festivals including the large Taste of Edmonton The Works Art Design Festival throughout the summer months The City of Calgary is also famous for its Stampede dubbed The Greatest Outdoor Show on Earth The Stampede is Canada biggest rodeo festival and features various races and competitions such as calf roping and bull riding In line with the western tradition of rodeo are the cultural artisans that reside and create unique Alberta
