formulated The oldest derivation of the word Andorra is from the Greek historian Polybius The Histories III who describe the Iberian Andosins tribes historically located in the valleys of Andorra facing the Carthaginian army in its passage through the Pyrenees during the Punic Wars The word Andosini or Andosins A may derive from the Basque handia whose meaning is big or giant The Andorran toponymy shows evidence of Basque language in the area Another theory suggests that the word Andorra may derive from the old word Anorra that contains the Basque word ur water One theory suggests that Andorra may derive from Arabic whose meaning is The Forest When the Moors invaded the Iberian Peninsula the valleys of the Pyrenees were formed by large tracts of forest and other regions and towns also dominated by Muslims received this designation Other theories suggest that the term derives from the andurrial which means land covered with bushes or scrubland The folk etymology holds that Charlemagne had called the region as a reference to the Biblical Canaanite valley of Endor or Andor where the Midianites had been defeated a name also bestowed by their heir and son Louis le Debonnaire after defeating the Moors in the wild valleys of Hell History Tradition holds that Charles the Great Charlemagne granted a charter to the Andorran people in return for fighting against the Moors Overlordship of the territory was by the Count of Urgell and eventually by the bishop of the Diocese of Urgell In Borrell II Count of Urgell gave the Andorran valleys to the Diocese of Urgell in exchange for land in Cerdanya Since then the Bishop of Urgell based in Seu has owned Andorra Before Andorra did not have any type of military protection and the Bishop of Urgell who knew that the Count of Urgell wanted to reclaim the Andorran valleys asked for help and protection from the Lord of Caboet In the Lord of Caboet and the Bishop of Urgell signed under oath a declaration of their over Andorra Arnalda daughter of Arnau of Caboet married the Viscount of Castellb and both became Viscounts of Castellb and Cerdanya Years later their daughter Ermessenda married Roger Bernat II the French Count of Foix They became Roger Bernat II and Ermessenda I Counts of Foix Viscounts of Castellb and Cerdanya and of Andorra shared with the Bishop of Urgell In the century a dispute arose between the Bishop of Urgell and the Count of Foix The conflict was resolved in with the mediation of Aragon by the signing of the first par age which provided that Andorra sovereignty be shared between the count of Foix whose title would ultimately transfer to the French head of state and the Bishop of Urgell in Catalonia This gave the principality its territory and political form Over the

times however its thriving tourist industry along with developments in transport and communications have removed the country from its isolation Its political system was modernised in when it became a member of the United Nations and the Council of Europe Politics Andorra is a parliamentary with the President of France and the Bishop of Urgell Catalonia Spain as This peculiarity makes the President

its own armed forces although there is a small ceremonial Army Responsibility for defending the nation rests primarily with France and Spain However in case of emergencies or natural disasters the Sometent an alarm is called and all men between and of Andorran nationality must serve This is why all Andorrans and especially the head of each house usually the eldest man of a house should by law keep a rifle even though the law also states that the police will offer a in case of need Andorra is a full member of the United Nations UN the Organization for Security and in Europe OSCE and has a special agreement with the European Union EU Military Andorra has a small army which has historically been raised or reconstituted at various dates but has never in modern times amounted to a standing army The basic principle of Andorran defence is that all men are available to fight if called upon by the sounding of the Sometent Being a landlocked country Andorra has no navy In the modern era the army has consisted of a very small body of volunteers willing to undertake ceremonial duties Uniforms were handed down from generation to generation within families and communities Despite not being involved in any fighting Andorra was technically the longest combatant in the First World War as the country was left out of the Versailles Peace Conference and technically remained at war with Germany from until The army role in internal security was largely taken over by the formation of the Police Corps of Andorra in Brief civil disorder associated with the elections of led to assistance being sought from the French National Gendarmerie with a detachment resident in Andorra for two months under the command of Ren Jules Baulard The Andorran Army was reformed in the following year with eleven soldiers appointed to supervisory roles The force consisted of six Corporals one for each parish although there are currently seven parishes there were only six until plus four junior staff officers to action and a commander with the rank of Major It was the responsibility of the six corporals each in his own parish to be able to raise a fighting force from among the men of the parish Today a small ceremonial unit remains the only permanent section of the Andorran Army but all men remain technically available for military service with a requirement for each family to have access to a firearm The army has not fought for more than years and its main responsibility is to present the flag of Andorra at official ceremonial functions According to Marc Forn Moln Andorra military budget is strictly from voluntary donations and the availability of voluntaries The myth that all members of the Andorran Army are ranked as officers is popularly maintained in many works of reference In reality all those serving in the permanent ceremonial reserve hold ranks as officers or officers because the other ranks are considered to be the rest of the male population who may still be called upon by the Sometent to serve although such a call has not been made in modern times GIPA The Grup Policia GIPA is a small special forces unit trained in and hostage recovery tasks Although it is the closest in style to an active military force it is part of the Police Corps and not the Army As terrorist and hostage situations are a rare threat to the nation the GIPA is commonly assigned to prisoner escort duties and at other times to routine policing Police Corps Andorra maintains a small but modern and internal police force with around police officers supported by civilian assistants The principal services supplied by the Corps are uniformed community policing criminal detection border control and traffic policing There are also small specialist units including police dogs mountain rescue and bomb disposal Fire brigade The Andorran Fire Brigade with headquarters at Santa Coloma operates from four modern fire stations and has a staff of around firefighters The service is equipped with heavy appliances fire tenders turntable ladders and specialist drive vehicles light support vehicles cars and vans and ambulances Historically the families of the six ancient parishes of Andorra maintained local arrangements to assist each other in fighting fires The first fire pump purchased by the government was acquired in The serious fires which lasted for two days in parts of the principality in December led to calls for a permanent fire service and the Andorran Fire Brigade was formed on April The fire service maintains cover with five fire crews on duty at any time two at the brigade headquarters in Santa Coloma and one crew at each of the other three fire stations Geography Parishes Andorra consists of seven parishes Physical geography Due to its location in the
