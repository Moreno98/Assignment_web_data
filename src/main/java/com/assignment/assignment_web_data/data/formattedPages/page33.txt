Definition NN
Suppose VB
we PRP
have VBP
a DT
data NN
set NN
containing VBG
the DT
values NNS
The DT
arithmetic NN
mean VB
is VBZ
defined VBN
by IN
the DT
formula NN
See VB

for IN

of IN

If IN
the DT

is VBZ
a DT
statistical JJ
population NN
consists VBZ
of IN
every DT
possible JJ
observation NN
and CC
not RB
just RB
a DT
subset NN
of IN
them PRP
then RB
the DT
mean NN
of IN
that DT
population NN
is VBZ
called VBN
the DT
population NN
mean NN
If IN
the DT
data NNS
set NN
is VBZ
a DT
statistical JJ
sample NN
a DT
subset NN
of IN
the DT
population NN
we PRP
call VBP
the DT
statistic NN
resulting VBG
from IN
this DT

a DT

The DT
arithmetic NN
mean NN
of IN
a DT

is VBZ
often RB
denoted VBN
by IN
a DT
bar NN
for IN

as IN
in IN

which WDT

the DT

of IN

Motivating VBG
properties NNS
The DT
arithmetic NN
mean NN
has VBZ
several JJ
properties NNS
that WDT
make VBP
it PRP
useful JJ
especially RB
as IN
a DT
measure NN
of IN
central JJ
tendency NN
These DT
include VBP
Contrast NN
with IN
median NN
The DT
arithmetic NN
mean NN
may MD
be VB
contrasted VBN
with IN
the DT
median NN
The DT
median NN
is VBZ
defined VBN
such JJ
that IN
half PDT
the DT
values NNS
are VBP
larger JJR
than IN
and CC
half NN
are VBP
smaller JJR
than IN
the DT
median NN
If IN
elements NNS
in IN
the DT
sample NN
data NNS
increase VBP
arithmetically RB
when WRB
placed VBN
in IN
some DT
order NN
then RB
the DT
median NN
and CC
arithmetic NN
average NN
are VBP
equal JJ
For IN
example NN
consider VB
the DT
data NNS
sample NN
The DT
average NN
is VBZ
as RB
is VBZ
the DT
median NN
However RB
when WRB
we PRP
consider VBP
a DT
sample NN
that WDT
can MD
not RB
be VB
arranged VBN
so RB
as IN
to TO
increase VB
arithmetically RB
such JJ
as IN
the DT
median NN
and CC
arithmetic NN
average NN
can MD
differ VB
significantly RB
In IN
this DT
case NN
the DT
arithmetic NN
average NN
is VBZ
and CC
the DT
median NN
is VBZ
In IN
general JJ
the DT
average JJ
value NN
can MD
vary VB
significantly RB
from IN
most JJS
values NNS
in IN
the DT
sample NN
and CC
can MD
be VB
larger JJR

smaller JJR

most JJS
of IN
them PRP
There EX
are VBP
applications NNS
of IN
this DT

in IN
many JJ

For IN

Generalizations NNS
Weighted JJ

A DT
weighted JJ
average NN

weighted JJ
mean NN
is VBZ
an DT
average NN
in IN
which WDT
some DT

more RBR
strongly RB

others NNS
in IN
that IN
they PRP
are VBP
given VBN
more RBR

in IN
the DT

For IN
example NN
the DT
arithmetic NN
mean NN
of IN

is VBZ

equivalently RB
In IN

often RB
in IN
the DT
general JJ
population NN

the DT

When WRB
a DT

take VB
on RP
any DT

then RB
the DT
probability NN

a DT

falling VBG

one CD
range NN
of IN
possible JJ

could MD
differ VB
from IN
the DT
probability NN

falling VBG

a DT
different JJ
range NN
of IN
possible JJ

even RB
if IN
the DT

both DT

the DT

In IN

the DT
