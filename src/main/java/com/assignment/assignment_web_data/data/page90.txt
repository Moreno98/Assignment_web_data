Actinopterygii Actinopterygii or the fishes constitute a class or subclass of the bony fishes The fishes are so called because they possess lepidotrichia or fin rays their fins being webs of skin supported by bony or horny spines rays as opposed to the fleshy lobed fins that characterize the class Sarcopterygii which also however possess lepidotrichia These actinopterygian fin rays attach directly to the proximal or basal skeletal elements the radials which represent the link or connection between these fins and the internal skeleton pelvic and pectoral girdles In terms of numbers actinopterygians are the dominant class of vertebrates comprising nearly of the over species of fish They are ubiquitous throughout freshwater and marine environments from the deep sea to the highest mountain streams Extant species can range in size from Paedocypris at to the massive ocean sunfish at and the oarfish at Characteristics File Anatomia dei thumb left A dorsal fin B fin rays C lateral line D kidney E swim bladder F Weberian apparatus G inner ear H brain I nostrils L eye M gills N heart O stomach P gall bladder Q spleen R internal sex organs ovaries or testes S ventral fins T spine U anal fin V tail caudal fin Possible other parts not shown barbels adipose fin external genitalia gonopodium fishes occur in many variant forms The main features of a typical fish are shown in the diagram at the left Fossil record The earliest known fossil actinopterygiian is Andreolepis hedei dating back million years Late Silurian Remains have been found in Russia Sweden and Estonia Classification Traditionally actinopterygians have been divided into the subclasses Chondrostei and Neopterygii Neopterygii in turn have been divided into the infraclasses Holostei and Teleostei Some morphological evidence suggests the Neopterygii is paraphyletic however recent work based on taxon orders is arranged in what has been suggested to represent the evolutionary sequence down to the level of order based primarily on the long history of morphological studies This classification like any other taxonomy based on phylogenetic research has been in a state of flux Recent morphological and molecular data have shown several of these ordinal and groupings represent evolutionary grades rather than clades Examples of demonstrably paraphyletic groups include the Paracanthopterygii Scorpaeniformes and Perciformes Studies of the nonteleostean actinopterygians shows that polypterids bichirs and ropefish are the sister lineage of all other actinopterygians Actinopteri Acipenseriformes sturgeons and paddlefishes are the sister lineage of Neopterygii and Holostei bowfin and gars are the sister lineage of teleosts The Elopomorpha eels and tarpons appears to be the most basic teleosts The listing below follows FishBase with notes when this differs from Nelson and ITIS
