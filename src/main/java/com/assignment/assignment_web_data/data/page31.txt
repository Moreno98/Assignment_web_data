Afroasiatic languages Afroasiatic also known as Afrasian and traditionally as is a large language family of several hundred related languages and dialects It comprises about or so living languages and dialects according to the Ethnologue estimate It includes languages spoken predominantly in the Middle East North Africa the Horn of Africa and parts of the Sahel The family is significant to the field of historical linguistics as possessing the longest recorded history of any language family languages have million native speakers the fourth largest number of any language family The most widely spoken Afroasiatic language Arabic including literary Arabic and the spoken colloquial varieties has about to million native speakers living mostly in the Middle East and in parts of North Africa Berber including all its varieties is spoken in Morocco Algeria Libya Tunisia northern Mali and northern Niger by about to million people Other widely spoken Afroasiatic languages include In addition to languages spoken today Afroasiatic includes several important ancient languages such as Ancient Egyptian Akkadian Biblical Hebrew and Aramaic Etymology The Afroasiatic language family was originally referred to as a term introduced in the by the German scholar Karl Richard Lepsius The name was later popularized by Friedrich M ller in his Grundriss der Sprachwissenschaft Wien The term Afroasiatic often now spelled as was later coined by Maurice Delafosse However it did not come into general use until Joseph Greenberg formally proposed its adoption In doing so Greenberg sought to emphasize the fact that Afroasiatic was represented transcontinentally in both Africa and Asia Individual scholars have also called the family Erythraean Tucker and Lisramic Hodge In lieu of the Russian linguist Igor Diakonoff later suggested the term Afrasian meaning half African half Asiatic in reference to the geographic distribution of the family constituent languages The term remains in use in the academic traditions of some European countries Distribution and branches The Afroasiatic language family is usually considered to include the following branches Although there is general agreement on these six families there are some points of disagreement among linguists who study Afroasiatic In particular Classification history In the century the Hebrew grammarian Judah ibn Quraysh of Tiaret in Algeria was the first to link two branches of Afroasiatic together he perceived a relationship between Berber and Semitic He knew of Semitic through his study of Arabic Hebrew and Aramaic In the course of the century Europeans also began suggesting such relationships In Theodor Benfey suggested a language family consisting of Semitic Berber and Cushitic calling the latter Ethiopic In the same year Newman suggested a relationship between Semitic and Hausa but this would long remain a topic of dispute and uncertainty Friedrich M ller named the traditional family in in his Grundriss der Sprachwissenschaft He defined it as consisting of a Semitic group plus a Hamitic group containing Egyptian Berber and Cushitic he excluded the Chadic group These classifications relied in part on anthropological and racial arguments that have largely been discredited see Hamitic hypothesis Leo Reinisch proposed linking Cushitic and Chadic while urging a more distant affinity to Egyptian and Semitic thus foreshadowing Greenberg but his suggestion found little resonance Marcel Cohen rejected the idea of a distinct Hamitic subgroup and included Hausa a Chadic language in his comparative vocabulary Joseph Greenberg strongly confirmed Cohen rejection of Hamitic added and the Chadic branch and proposed the new name Afroasiatic for the family Nearly all scholars have accepted Greenberg classification In Harold Fleming proposed that what had previously been known as Western Cushitic is an independent branch of Afroasiatic suggesting for it the new name Omotic This proposal and name have met with widespread acceptance Several scholars including Harold Fleming and Robert Hetzron have since questioned the traditional inclusion of Beja in Cushitic Glottolog does not accept that the inclusion or even unity of Omotic has been established nor that of Ongota or the unclassified Kujarge and so splits off the following groups as small families Subgrouping Little agreement exists on the subgrouping of the five or six branches of Afroasiatic Semitic Egyptian Berber Chadic Cushitic and Omotic However Christopher Ehret Harold Fleming and Joseph Greenberg all agree that the Omotic branch split from the rest first Otherwise Position among the world languages Afroasiatic is one of the four language families of Africa identified by Joseph Greenberg in his book The Languages of Africa It is the only one that extends outside of Africa via the Semitic branch There are no generally accepted relations between Afroasiatic and any other language family However several proposals grouping Afroasiatic with one or more other language families have been made The of these are the following Date of Afroasiatic The earliest written evidence of an Afroasiatic language is an Ancient Egyptian inscription of BC years ago Symbols on Gerzean pottery resembling Egyptian hieroglyphs date back to BC suggesting a still earlier possible date This gives us a minimum date for the age of Afroasiatic However Ancient Egyptian is highly divergent from Trombetti and considerable time must have elapsed in between them Estimates of the date at which the language was spoken vary widely They fall within a range between approximately BC years ago and approximately BC years ago According to Igor Diakonoff was spoken BC According to Christopher Ehret was spoken BC at the latest and possibly as early as BC These dates are older than dates associated with most other Afroasiatic Urheimat The term Afroasiatic Urheimat Urheimat meaning original homeland in German refers to the hypothetical place where speakers lived in a single linguistic community or complex of communities before this original language dispersed geographically and divided into distinct languages Afroasiatic languages are today primarily spoken in the Middle East North Africa the Horn of Africa and parts of the Sahel Their distribution seems to have been influenced by the Saharan pump operating over the last years There is no agreement on when and where this Urheimat existed though is generally believed to have originated somewhere in the area between the Eastern Sahara and the Horn of Africa including Egypt Ethiopia and Sudan Similarities in grammar and syntax Widespread though not universal features of the Afroasiatic languages include One of the most remarkable shared features among the Afroasiatic languages is the prefixing verb conjugation see table above with a distinctive pattern of prefixes beginning with t n y and in particular a pattern whereby masculine y is opposed to feminine and t According to Ehret tonal languages appear in the Omotic and Chadic branches of Afroasiatic as well as in certain Cushitic languages The Semitic Berber and Egyptian branches generally do not use tones phonemically Shared vocabulary The following are some examples of Afroasiatic cognates including ten pronouns three nouns and three verbs There are two etymological dictionaries of Afroasiatic one by Christopher Ehret and one by Vladimir Orel and Olga Stolbova The two dictionaries disagree on almost everything The following table contains the thirty roots or so out of thousands that represent a
