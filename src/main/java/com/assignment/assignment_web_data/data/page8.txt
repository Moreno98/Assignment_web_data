An American in Paris An American in Paris is a symphonic poem by the American composer George Gershwin written in Inspired by the time Gershwin had spent in Paris it evokes the sights and energy of the French capital in the and is one of his compositions Gershwin composed An American in Paris on commission from the conductor Walter Damrosch He scored the piece for the standard instruments of the symphony orchestra plus celesta saxophones and automobile horns He brought back some Parisian taxi horns for the New York premiere of the composition which took place on December in Carnegie Hall with Damrosch conducting the New York Philharmonic Gershwin completed the orchestration on November less than four weeks before the work premiere Gershwin collaborated on the original program notes with the critic and composer Deems Taylor noting that My purpose here is to portray the impression of an American visitor in Paris as he strolls about the city and listens to various street noises and absorbs the French atmosphere When the tone poem moves into the blues our American friend has succumbed to a spasm of homesickness But nostalgia is not a fatal disease The American visitor once again is an alert spectator of Parisian life and the street noises and French atmosphere are triumphant Background Maurice Ravel met Gershwin in New York during Ravel tour of the United States In that meeting Gershwin asked Ravel to be his teacher to which Ravel responded that it was better to be a Gershwin than a Ravel Instead Ravel recommended that Gershwin see Nadia Boulanger in Paris Ravel high praise of Gershwin in an introductory letter to Boulanger caused Gershwin to seriously consider taking time to study abroad in Paris Gershwin arrived in Paris in March Paris at this time hosted many expatriate writers among them Ezra Pound Yeats Ernest Hemingway and artist Pablo Picasso Gershwin met with Boulanger and at her request he played ten minutes of his music Boulanger replied that she had nothing to teach him This did not set Gershwin back as his real intent abroad was to complete a new work based on Paris and perhaps a second rhapsody for piano and orchestra to follow his Rhapsody in Blue Composition Gershwin based An American in Paris on a melodic fragment called Very Parisienne written in on his first visit to Paris as a gift to his hosts Robert and Mabel Schirmer He described the piece as a rhapsodic ballet because it was written freely and is more modern than his previous works Gershwin explained in Musical America My purpose here is to portray the impressions of an American visitor in Paris as he strolls about the city listens to the various street noises and absorbs the French atmosphere The piece is structured into five sections which culminate in a loose ABA format Gershwin first A episode introduces the two main walking themes in the Allegretto grazioso and develops a third theme in the Subito con brio The style of this A section is written in the typical French style of composers Claude Debussy and Les Six This A section featured duple meter singsong rhythms and diatonic melodies with the sounds of oboe English horn and taxi horns The B section Andante ma con ritmo deciso introduces the American Blues and spasms of homesickness The Allegro that follows continues to express homesickness in a faster blues In the B section Gershwin uses common time syncopated rhythms and bluesy melodies with the sounds of trumpet saxophone and snare drum Moderato con grazia is the last A section that returns to the themes set in A After recapitulating the walking themes Gershwin overlays the slow blues theme from section B in the final Grandioso Instrumentation An American in Paris is scored for flutes doubling on piccolo oboes English horn clarinets in B flat bass clarinet in B flat bassoons horns in F trumpets in B flat trombones tuba timpani snare drum bass drum triangle wood block cymbals low and high xylophone glockenspiel celesta taxi horns labeled as A B C and D alto saxophone tenor saxophone baritone saxophone and strings The revised edition by calls for three saxophones alto tenor and baritone In this arrangement the soprano and alto doublings have been rewritten to avoid changing instruments William Daly arranged the score for piano solo which was published by New World Music in Response Gershwin did not particularly like Walter Damrosch interpretation at the world premiere of An American in Paris He stated that Damrosch sluggish dragging tempo caused him to walk out of the hall during a matinee performance of this work The audience according to Edward Cushing responded with a demonstration of enthusiasm impressively genuine in contrast to the conventional applause which new music good and bad ordinarily arouses Critics believed that An American in Paris was better crafted than his lukewarm Concerto in F Some did not think it belonged in a program with classical composers C sar Franck Richard Wagner or Guillaume Lekeu on its premiere Gershwin responded to the critics It not a Beethoven Symphony you know It a humorous piece nothing solemn about it It not intended to draw tears If it pleases symphony audiences as a light jolly piece a series of impressions musically expressed it succeeds Preservation status On September it was announced that a musicological critical edition of the full orchestral score will be eventually released The Gershwin family working in conjunction with the Library of Congress and the University of Michigan are working to make scores available to the public that represent Gershwin true intent It is unknown if the critical score will include the material Gershwin later deleted from the work such as the restatement of the blues theme after the faster bar blues section or if the score will document changes in the orchestration during Gershwin composition process The score to An American in Paris is currently scheduled to be issued first in a series of scores to be released The project may take to years to complete The first edition will probably be published by Recordings An American in Paris has been frequently recorded The first recording was made for RCA Victor in with Nathaniel Shilkret conducting the Victor Symphony Orchestra drawn from members of the Philadelphia Orchestra Gershwin was on hand to supervise the recording however Shilkret was reported to be in charge and eventually asked the composer to leave the recording studio Then a little later Shilkret discovered there was no one to play the brief celesta solo during the slow section so he hastily asked Gershwin if he might play the solo Gershwin said he could and so he briefly participated in the actual recording The radio broadcast of the September Hollywood Bowl George Gershwin Memorial Concert in which An American in Paris also conducted by Shilkret was second on the program was recorded and was released in in a set Arthur Fiedler and the Boston Pops Orchestra recorded the work for RCA Victor including one of the first stereo recordings of the music In Arturo Toscanini and the NBC Symphony Orchestra recorded the music in Carnegie Hall one of the few commercial recordings Toscanini made of music by an American composer The Seattle Symphony also recorded a version in of Gershwin original score before he made numerous edits resulting in the score as we hear it today Use in film In MGM released the musical An American in Paris featuring Gene Kelly and Leslie Caron Winning the Best Picture Oscar and numerous other awards the film was directed by Vincente Minnelli featured many tunes of Gershwin and concluded with an extensive elaborate dance sequence built around the An American in Paris symphonic poem arranged for the film by Johnny Green costing A part of the symphonic composition is also featured in As Good as It Gets released in
