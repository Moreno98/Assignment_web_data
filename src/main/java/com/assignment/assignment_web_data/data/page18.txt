communes With a population of million it is the most populated country on Earth Abdelaziz Bouteflika has been the President of Algeria since and has won four consecutive elections Algeria economy is largely based on hydrocarbons due to which manufacturing has suffered from Dutch disease The country supplies large amounts of natural gas to Europe and energy exports are the backbone of the economy According to OPEC Algeria has the largest reserves of oil in the world and the second largest in Africa while it has the largest reserves of natural gas Sonatrach the national oil company is the largest company in Africa Algeria has the second largest military in North Africa with the largest defence budget in Africa Algeria has had a peaceful nuclear program since the Algeria is a member of the African Union the Arab League OPEC and the United Nations and is a founding member of the Arab Maghreb Union Etymology The country name derives from the city of Algiers The city name in turn derives from the Arabic ir The Islands a truncated form of the older Jaz ir Ban Mazghanna Islands of the Mazghanna Tribe employed by medieval geographers such as History Ancient history In the region of Ain Hanech Sa da Province early remnants BC of hominid occupation in North Africa were found Neanderthal tool makers produced hand axes in the Levalloisian and Mousterian styles BC similar to those in the Levant Algeria was the site of the highest state of development of Middle Paleolithic Flake tool techniques Tools of this era starting about BC are called Aterian after the archeological site of Bir el Ater south of Tebessa The earliest blade industries in North Africa are called Iberomaurusian located mainly in Oran region This industry appears to have spread throughout the coastal regions of the Maghreb between and BC Neolithic civilization animal domestication and agriculture developed in the Saharan and Mediterranean Maghreb perhaps as early as BC or as late as between and BC This life richly depicted in the Tassili paintings predominated in Algeria until the classical period The amalgam of peoples of North Africa coalesced eventually into a distinct native population that came to be called Berbers who are the indigenous peoples of northern Africa From their principal center of power at Carthage the Carthaginians expanded and established small settlements along the North African coast by BC a Phoenician presence existed at Tipasa east of Cherchell Hippo Regius modern Annaba and Rusicade modern Skikda These settlements served as market towns as well as anchorages As Carthaginian power grew its impact on the indigenous population increased dramatically Berber civilization was already at a stage in which agriculture manufacturing trade and political organization supported several states Trade links between Carthage and the Berbers in the interior grew but territorial expansion also resulted in the enslavement or military recruitment of some Berbers and in the extraction of tribute from others By the early century BC Berbers formed the single largest element of the Carthaginian army In the Revolt of the Mercenaries Berber soldiers rebelled from to BC after being unpaid following the defeat of Carthage in the First Punic War They succeeded in obtaining control of much of Carthage North African territory and they minted coins bearing the name Libyan used in Greek to describe natives of North Africa The Carthaginian state declined because of successive defeats by the Romans in the Punic Wars In BC the city of Carthage was destroyed As Carthaginian power waned the influence of Berber leaders in the hinterland grew By the century BC several large but loosely administered Berber kingdoms had emerged Two of them were established in Numidia behind the coastal areas controlled by Carthage West of Numidia lay Mauretania which extended across the Moulouya River in modern day Morocco to the Atlantic Ocean The high point of Berber civilization unequaled until the coming of the Almohads and Almoravids more than a millennium later was reached during the reign of Massinissa in the century BC After Masinissa death in BC the Berber kingdoms were divided and reunited several times Massinissa line survived until AD when the remaining Berber territory was annexed to the Roman Empire For several centuries Algeria was ruled by the Romans who founded many colonies in the region Like the rest of North Africa Algeria was one of the breadbaskets of the empire exporting cereals and other agricultural products The Vandals of Geiseric moved into North Africa in and by controlled coastal Numidia They did not make any significant settlement on the land as they were harassed by local tribes in fact by the time the Byzantines arrived Lepcis Magna was abandoned and the Msellata region was occupied by the indigenous Laguatan who had been busy facilitating an Amazigh political military and cultural revival Middle Ages After fierce resistance from the locals the Muslims conquered Algeria in the century and a large number of the indigenous people converted to the new faith After the fall of the Umayyad Caliphate in numerous local dynasties emerged including the Aghlabids Almohads Abdalwadid Zirids Rustamids Hammadids Almoravids and the Fatimids During the Middle Ages North Africa and Algeria more specifically was home to many great Scholars Saints and Sovereigns including Judah Ibn Quryash the first grammarian to suggest the Language Family the great Sufi masters Sidi Boumediene Abu Madyan and Sidi El Houari as well as the Emirs Abd Al Mu min and Y ghm rasen It was during this time period that the Fatimids or children of Fatima daughter of Muhammad according to Fatimid claims came to the Maghreb These Fatimids went on to found a long lasting dynasty stretching across the Maghreb Hejaz and the Levant boasting a secular inner government as well as a powerful army and navy primarily made of native North Africans Arabs and levantians extending from Algeria to their capital state of Cairo The Fatimid caliphate began to collapse when it African governors the Zirids seceded In order to punish them the Fatimids sent the Arab Banu Hilal and Banu Sulaym against them The resultant war is recounted in the epic T ghrib t In ghr b t the Amazigh Zirid Hero Kh l f nat asks daily for duels defeating the Hilalan hero bu Zayd and many other Arab knights in a string of victories The Zirids however were unexpectedly defeated ushering in an influx of Arab customs and culture The indigenous Amazigh tribes however remained largely independent and depending on tribe location and time controlled varying parts of the Maghreb at times unifying it as under the Fatimids The Fatimid Islamic state also known as Fatimid Caliphate made an Islamic empire that included North Africa Sicily Palestine Jordan Lebanon Syria the Red Sea coast of Africa Tihamah Hejaz and Yemen Caliphates from Northern Africa traded tit for tat with the other empires of their time as well as forming part of a confederated support and trade network with other Islamic states during the highly competitive Islamic Era The Amazighs historically consisted of several tribes The two main branches were the Botr and Barn s tribes who were divided into tribes and again into Each region of the Maghreb contained several tribes for example Sanhadja Houaras Zenata Masmouda Kutama Awarba and Berghwata All these tribes made independent territorial decisions Several Amazigh dynasties emerged during the Middle Ages in the Maghreb and other nearby lands Ibn Khaldun provides a table summarizing the Amazigh dynasties of the Maghreb region the Zirid Banu Ifran Maghrawa Almoravid Hammadid Almohad Merinid Abdalwadid Wattasid Meknassa and Hafsid dynasties In the early century Spain constructed fortified outposts presidios on or near the Algerian coast Spain took control of Mers el Kebir in Oran in and Tlemcen Mostaganem and T n s in In the same year the merchants of Algiers ceded one of the rocky islets in their harbor to Spain which built a fort on it The presidios in North Africa turned out to be a costly and largely ineffective military endeavor that did not guarantee access for Spain merchant fleet Ottoman Algeria In the Turk Muslim privateer brothers Aruj and Hayreddin Barbarossa who operated successfully under the Hafsids moved their base of operations to Algiers They succeeded in liberating Jijel and Algiers from the Spaniards but eventually assumed control over the city and the surrounding region forcing the previous ruler Abu Hamo Musa III of the Bani Ziyad dynasty to flee When Aruj was killed in during his invasion of Tlemcen Hayreddin succeeded him as military commander of Algiers The Ottoman sultan gave him the title of beylerbey and a contingent of some janissaries With the aid of this force Hayreddin the coastal region between Constantine and Oran although the city of Oran remained in Spanish hands until The next beylerbey was Hayreddin son Hasan who assumed the position in Until the area was governed by officers who served terms with no fixed limits Subsequently with the institution of a regular Ottoman administration governors with the title of pasha ruled for terms The pasha was assisted by janissaries known in Algeria as the ojaq and led by an agha Discontent among the ojaq rose in the because they were not paid regularly and they repeatedly revolted against the pasha As a result the agha charged the pasha with corruption and incompetence and seized power in Plague had repeatedly struck the cities of North Africa Algiers lost from to inhabitants to the plague in and suffered high fatalities in and In the taifa rebelled killed the agha and placed one of its own in power The new leader received the title of dey After the right to select the dey passed to the divan a council of some sixty notables It was at first dominated by the ojaq but by the century it had become the dey instrument In the dey persuaded the sultan to recognize him and his successors as regent replacing the pasha in that role Although Algiers remained a part of the Ottoman Empire the Ottoman government ceased to have effective influence there The dey was in effect a constitutional autocrat The dey was elected for a life term but in the years that the system survived fourteen of the deys were assassinated Despite usurpation military coups and occasional mob rule the operation of government was remarkably orderly Although the regency patronized the tribal chieftains it never had the unanimous allegiance of the countryside where heavy taxation frequently provoked unrest Autonomous tribal states were tolerated and the regency authority was seldom applied in the Kabylie Privateers era The Barbary pirates preyed on Christian and other shipping in the western Mediterranean Sea The pirates often took the passengers and crew on the ships and sold them or used them as slaves They also did a brisk business in ransoming some of the captives According to Robert Davis from the to century pirates captured million to million Europeans as slaves They often made raids called Razzias on European coastal towns to capture Christian slaves to sell at slave markets in North Africa and the Ottoman Empire In Hayreddin captured the island of Ischia taking prisoners and enslaved some inhabitants of Lipari almost the entire population In Turgut Reis enslaved the entire population of the Maltese island of Gozo between and sending the captives to Libya In pirates sacked Vieste in southern Italy and took an estimated captives as slaves In Barbary corsairs captured the town of Ciutadella Minorca destroyed it slaughtered the inhabitants and took survivors as slaves to Istanbul Barbary pirates often attacked the Balearic Islands and in response the residents built many coastal watchtowers and fortified churches The threat was so severe that residents abandoned the island of Formentera Between to England lost merchant ships to Barbary pirates In July two pirate ships from Algiers sailed as far as Iceland raiding and capturing slaves Two weeks earlier another pirate ship from Sal in Morocco had also raided in Iceland Some of the slaves brought to Algiers were later ransomed back to Iceland but some chose to stay in Algeria In pirate ships from Algeria raided the Faroe Islands In the century the pirates forged affiliations with Caribbean powers paying a license tax in exchange for safe harbor of their vessels One American slave reported that the Algerians had enslaved American seamen in the Mediterranean and Atlantic from to Piracy on American vessels in the Mediterranean resulted in the United States initiating the First and Second Barbary Wars Following those wars Algeria was weaker and Europeans with an fleet commanded by the British Lord Exmouth attacked Algiers After a bombardment they obtained a treaty from the Dey that reaffirmed the conditions imposed by Decatur US navy concerning the demands of tributes In addition the Dey agreed to end the practice of enslaving Christians The French colonisation of Algeria On the pretext of a slight to their consul the French invaded and captured Algiers in The conquest of Algeria by the French took some time and resulted in considerable bloodshed A combination of violence and disease epidemics caused the indigenous Algerian population to decline by nearly from to The population of Algeria which stood at about million in reached nearly million in French policy was predicated on civilizing the country Algeria social fabric suffered during the occupation literacy plummeted During this period a small but influential indigenous elite was formed made up of Berbers mostly from Kabyles As a consequence French government favored the Kabyles About of Indigenous Schools were constructed for Kabyles From until independence France administered the whole Mediterranean region of Algeria as an integral part and d partement of the nation One of France overseas territories Algeria became a destination for hundreds of thousands of European immigrants who became known as colons and later as Between and French people emigrated to Algeria These settlers benefited from the French government confiscation of communal land from tribal peoples and the application of modern agricultural techniques that increased the amount of arable land Gradually dissatisfaction among the Muslim population which lacked political and economic status in the colonial system gave rise to demands for greater political autonomy and eventually independence from France Tensions between the two population groups came to a head in when the first violent events of what was later called the Algerian War began Historians have estimated that between and Harkis and their dependents were killed by the Front de Lib ration Nationale FLN or by lynch mobs in Algeria The FLN used terrorist attacks in Algeria and France as part of its war and the French conducted severe reprisals The war led to the death of hundreds of thousands of Algerians and hundreds of thousands of injuries The war concluded in when Algeria gained complete independence following the March Evian agreements and the July referendum Independence Algeria first president was the FLN leader Ahmed Ben Bella Morocco claim to portions of western Algeria led to the Sand War in Ben Bella was overthrown in by Houari Boumediene his former ally and defense minister Under Ben Bella the government had become increasingly socialist and authoritarian Boum dienne continued this trend But he relied much more on the army for his support and reduced the sole legal party to a symbolic role He collectivised agriculture and launched a massive industrialization drive Oil extraction facilities were nationalized This was especially beneficial to the leadership after the international oil crisis In the and under President Houari Boumediene Algeria pursued a programme of industrialisation within a socialist economy Boumediene successor Chadli Bendjedid introduced some liberal economic reforms He promoted a policy of Arabisation in Algerian society and public life Teachers of Arabic brought in from other Muslim countries spread radical Islamic thought in schools and sowed the seeds of political Islamism The Algerian economy became increasingly dependent on oil leading to hardship when the price collapsed during the oil glut Economic recession caused by the crash in world oil prices resulted in Algerian social unrest during the by the end of the decade Bendjedid introduced a system Political parties developed such as the Islamic Salvation Front FIS a broad coalition of Islamist groups Civil War and aftermath In December the Islamic Salvation Front dominated the first of two rounds of legislative elections Fearing the election of an Islamist government the authorities intervened on January cancelling the elections Bendjedid resigned and a High Council of State was installed to act as Presidency It banned the FIS triggering a civil insurgency between the Front armed wing the Armed Islamic Group and the national armed forces in which more than people are thought to have died The Islamist militants conducted a violent campaign of civilian massacres At several points in the conflict the situation in Algeria became a point of international concern most notably during the crisis surrounding Air France Flight a hijacking perpetrated by the Armed Islamic Group The Armed Islamic Group declared a ceasefire in October Algeria held elections in considered biased by international observers and most opposition groups which were won by President Abdelaziz Bouteflika He

dication et le Combat GSPC a splinter group of the Group Islamic Arm e continued a terrorist campaign against the Government Bouteflika was in the April presidential election after campaigning on a programme of national reconciliation The programme comprised economic institutional political and social reform to modernise the country raise living standards and tackle the causes of alienation It also included a second amnesty initiative the Charter for Peace and National Reconciliation which was approved in a referendum in September It offered amnesty to most guerrillas and Government
