Abacus The abacus plural abaci or abacuses also called a counting frame is a calculating tool that was in use centuries before the adoption of the written modern numeral system and is still widely used by merchants traders and clerks in Asia Africa and elsewhere Today abaci are often constructed as a bamboo frame with beads sliding on wires but originally they were beans or stones moved in grooves in sand or on tablets of wood stone or metal The user of an abacus is called an abacist Etymology The use of the word abacus dates before AD when a Middle English work borrowed the word from Latin to describe a sandboard abacus The Latin word came from Greek abax which means something without base and improperly any piece of rectangular board or plank Alternatively without reference to ancient texts on etymology it has been suggested that it means a square tablet strewn with dust or covered with dust for the use of mathematics the exact shape of the Latin perhaps reflects the genitive form of the Greek word o abakos Whereas the table strewn with dust definition is popular there are those that do not place credence in this at all and in fact state that it is not proven Greek itself is probably a borrowing of a Northwest Semitic perhaps Phoenician word akin to Hebrew b q dust or in sense meaning sand used as a writing surface The preferred plural of abacus is a subject of disagreement with both abacuses and abaci in use History Mesopotamian The period BC saw the first appearance of the Sumerian abacus a table of successive columns which delimited the successive orders of magnitude of their sexagesimal number system Some scholars point to a character from the Babylonian cuneiform which may have been derived from a representation of the abacus It is the belief of Old Babylonian scholars such as Carruccio that Old Babylonians may have used the abacus for the operations of addition and subtraction however this primitive device proved difficult to use for more complex calculations Egyptian The use of the abacus in Ancient Egypt is mentioned by the Greek historian Herodotus who writes that the Egyptians manipulated the pebbles from right to left opposite in direction to the Greek method Archaeologists have found ancient disks of various sizes that are thought to have been used as counters However wall depictions of this instrument have not been discovered casting some doubt over the extent to which this instrument was used Persian During the Achaemenid Persian Empire around BC the Persians first began to use the abacus Under Parthian and Sassanian Iranian empires scholars concentrated on exchanging knowledge and inventions by the countries around them India China and the Roman Empire when it is thought to be expanded over the other countries Greek The earliest archaeological evidence for the use of the Greek abacus dates to the century BC Also Demosthenes BC BC talked of the need to use pebbles for calculations too difficult for your head A play by Alexis from the century BC mentions an abacus and pebbles for accounting and both Diogenes and Polybius mention men that sometimes stood for more and sometimes for less like the pebbles on an abacus The Greek abacus was a table of wood or marble with small counters in wood or metal for mathematical calculations This Greek abacus saw use in Achaemenid Persia the Etruscan civilization Ancient Rome and until the French Revolution the Western Christian world A tablet found on the Greek island Salamis in AD the Salamis Tablet dates back to BC making it the oldest counting board discovered so far It is a slab of white marble long wide and thick on which are groups of markings In the center of the tablet is a set of parallel lines equally divided by a vertical line capped with a semicircle at the intersection of the horizontal line and the single vertical line Below these lines is a wide space with a horizontal crack dividing it Below this crack is another group of eleven parallel lines again divided into two sections by a line perpendicular to them but with the semicircle at the top of the intersection the third sixth and ninth of these lines are marked with a cross where they intersect with the vertical line Also from this time frame the Darius Vase was unearthed in It was covered with pictures including a treasurer holding a wax tablet in one hand while manipulating counters on a table with the other Roman The normal method of calculation in ancient Rome as in Greece was by moving counters on a smooth table Originally pebbles calculi were used Later and in medieval Europe jetons were manufactured Marked lines indicated units fives tens as in the Roman numeral system This system of counter casting continued into the late Roman empire and in medieval Europe and persisted in limited use into the nineteenth century Due to Pope Sylvester II reintroduction of the abacus with very useful modifications it became widely used in Europe once again during the century This abacus used beads on wires unlike the traditional Roman counting boards which meant the abacus could be used that much faster Writing in the century BC Horace refers to the wax abacus a board covered with a thin layer of black wax on which columns and figures were inscribed using a stylus One example of archaeological evidence of the Roman abacus shown here in reconstruction dates to the century AD It has eight long grooves containing up to five beads in each and eight shorter grooves having either one or no beads in each The groove marked I indicates units X tens and so on up to millions The beads in the shorter grooves denote fives five units five tens essentially in a coded decimal system obviously related to the Roman numerals The short grooves on the right may have been used for marking Roman ounces fractions Chinese The earliest known written documentation of the Chinese abacus dates to the century BC The Chinese abacus known as the su np n lit Counting tray is typically tall and comes in various widths depending on the operator It usually has more than seven rods There are two beads on each rod in the upper deck and five beads each in the bottom for both decimal and hexadecimal computation The beads are usually rounded and made of a hardwood The beads are counted by moving them up or down towards the beam If you move them toward the beam you count their value If you move away you do count their value The suanpan can be reset to the starting position instantly by a quick movement along the horizontal axis to spin all the beads away from the horizontal beam at the center Suanpans can be used for functions other than counting Unlike the simple counting board used in elementary schools very efficient suanpan techniques have been developed to do multiplication division addition subtraction square root and cube root operations at high speed There are currently schools teaching students how to use it In the long scroll Along the River During the Qingming Festival painted by Zhang Zeduan AD during the Song Dynasty AD a suanpan is clearly seen lying beside an account book and doctor prescriptions on the counter of an apothecary Feibao The similarity of the Roman abacus to the Chinese one suggests that one could have inspired the other as there is some evidence of a trade relationship between the Roman Empire and China However no direct connection can be demonstrated and the similarity of the abaci may be coincidental both ultimately arising from counting with five fingers per hand Where the Roman model like most modern Korean and Japanese has plus bead per decimal place the standard suanpan has plus Incidentally this allows use with a hexadecimal numeral system Instead of running on wires as in the Chinese Korean and Japanese models the beads of Roman model run in grooves presumably making arithmetic calculations much slower Another possible source of the suanpan is Chinese counting rods which operated with a decimal system but lacked the concept of zero as a place holder The zero was probably introduced to the Chinese in the Tang Dynasty AD when travel in the Indian Ocean and the Middle East would have provided direct contact with India allowing them to acquire the concept of zero and the decimal point from Indian merchants and mathematicians Indian The Abhidharmako abh ya of Vasubandhu a Sanskrit work on Buddhist philosophy says that the CE philosopher Vasumitra said that placing a wick Sanskrit vartik on the number one ek ka means it is a one while placing the wick on the number hundred means it is called a hundred and on the number one thousand means it is called a thousand It is unclear exactly what this arrangement may have been but it could refer to tokens being cast into or placed on numbered squares Perhaps it was a type of abacus Around the century Indian clerks were already finding new ways of recording the contents of the Abacus Hindu texts used the term h nya zero to indicate the empty column on the abacus Japanese In Japanese the abacus is called soroban lit Counting tray imported from China in the century It was probably in use by the working class a century or more before the ruling class started as the class structure did not allow for devices used by the lower class to be adopted or used by the ruling class The abacus which is suited to decimal calculation appeared circa and became widespread as the Japanese abandoned hexadecimal weight calculation which was still common in China The abacus is still manufactured in Japan today even with the proliferation practicality and affordability of pocket electronic calculators The use of the soroban is still taught in Japanese primary schools as part of mathematics primarily as an aid to faster mental calculation Using visual imagery of a soroban one can arrive at the answer in the same time as or even faster than is possible with a physical instrument Korean The Chinese abacus migrated from China to Korea around AD Koreans call it jupan supan or calculating with an abacus Native American Some sources mention the use of an abacus called a nepohualtzintzin in ancient Aztec culture This Mesoamerican abacus used a system The word Nep hualtzintzin comes from the Nahuatl and it is formed by the roots Ne personal p hual or p hualli the account and tzintzin small similar elements And its complete meaning was taken as counting with small similar elements by somebody Its use was taught in the Calmecac to the temalpouhqueh who were students dedicated to take the accounts of skies from childhood Unfortunately the Nep hualtzintzin and its teaching were among the victims of the conquering destruction when a diabolic origin was attributed to them after observing the tremendous properties of representation precision and speed of calculations For the Aztec the count by was completely natural The amount of and other cyclees meant cycles The Nep hualtzintzin was divided in two main parts separated by a bar or intermediate cord In the left part there were four beads which in the first row have unitary values and and in the right side there are three beads with values of and respectively In order to know the value of the respective beads of the upper rows it is enough to multiply by by each row the value of the corresponding account in the first row Altogether there were rows with beads in each one which made up beads in each Nep hualtzintzin This was a basic number to understand times a close relation conceived between natural phenomena the underworld and the cycles of the heavens One Nep hualtzintzin represented the number of days that a season of the year lasts two Nep hualtzitzin is the number of days of the corn cycle from its sowing to its harvest three Nep hualtzintzin is the number of days of a baby gestation and four Nep hualtzintzin completed a cycle and approximate a year days short The Nep hualtzintzin amounted to the rank from to the in floating point which calculated stellar as well as infinitesimal amounts with absolute precision meant that no round off was allowed when translated into modern computer arithmetic The rediscovery of the Nep hualtzintzin was due to the Mexican engineer David Esparza Hidalgo who in his wanderings throughout Mexico found diverse engravings and paintings of this instrument and reconstructed several of them made in gold jade encrustations of shell There have also been found very old Nep hualtzintzin attributed to the Olmeca culture and even some bracelets of Mayan origin as well as a diversity of forms and materials in other cultures George Sanchez Arithmetic in Maya found another base base abacus in the Yucat n that also computed calendar data This was a finger abacus on one hand and were used and on the other hand used and were used Note the use of zero at the beginning and end of the two cycles Sanchez worked with Sylvanus Morley a noted Mayanist The quipu of the Incas was a system of colored knotted cords used to record numerical data like advanced tally sticks but not used to perform calculations Calculations were carried out using a yupana Quechua for counting tool see figure which was still in use after the conquest of Peru The working principle of a yupana is unknown but in an explanation of the mathematical basis of these instruments was proposed by Italian mathematician Nicolino De Pasquale By comparing the form of several yupanas researchers found that calculations were based using the Fibonacci sequence and powers of and as place values for the different fields in the instrument Using the Fibonacci sequence would keep the number of grains within any one field at minimum Russian The Russian abacus the schoty usually has a single slanted deck with ten beads on each wire except one wire usually positioned near the user with four beads for fractions Older models have another wire for which were minted until The Russian abacus is often used vertically with wires from left to right in the manner of a book The wires are usually bowed to bulge upward in the center to keep the beads pinned to either of the two sides It is cleared when all the beads are moved to the right During manipulation beads are moved to the left For easy viewing the middle beads on each wire the and bead usually are of a different colour from the other eight beads Likewise the left bead of the thousands wire and the million wire if present may have a different color As a simple cheap and reliable device the Russian abacus was in use in all shops and markets throughout the former Soviet Union and the usage of it was taught in most schools until the Even the invention of mechanical calculator Odhner arithmometer had not replaced them in Russia and likewise the mass production of Felix arithmometers since did not significantly reduce their use in the Soviet Union Russian abacus began to lose popularity only after the mass production of microcalculators had started in the Soviet Union in Today it is regarded as an archaism and replaced by the handheld calculator The Russian abacus was brought to France around by the mathematician Poncelet who served in Napoleon army and had been a prisoner of war in Russia The abacus had fallen out of use in western Europe in the century with the rise of decimal notation and algorismic methods To Poncelet French contemporaries it was something new Poncelet used it not for any applied purpose but as a teaching and demonstration aid The Turks and the Armenian people also used abaci similar to the Russian schoty It was named a coulba by the Turks and a choreb by the Armenians School abacus Around the world abaci have been used in and elementary schools as an aid in teaching the numeral system and arithmetic In Western countries a bead frame similar to the Russian abacus but with straight wires and a vertical frame has been common see image It is still often seen as a plastic or wooden toy This type of abacus uses a row of beads to represent arithmetical columns thus the top row represents units the second tens the third hundreds and so on Most of these abaci consist of rows thus count up to The abacus is used in contemporary primary schools for a wide range of lessons The twenty bead version referred to by its Dutch name rekenrek is often used sometimes on a string of beads sometimes on a rigid framework Uses by the blind An adapted abacus invented by Tim Cranmer called a Cranmer abacus is still commonly used by individuals who are blind A piece of soft fabric or rubber is placed behind the beads so that they do not move inadvertently This keeps the beads in place while the users feel or manipulate them They use an abacus to perform the mathematical functions multiplication division addition subtraction square root and cubic root Although blind students have benefited from talking calculators the abacus is still very often taught to these students in early grades both in public schools and state schools for the blind The abacus teaches mathematical skills that can never be replaced with talking calculators and is an important learning tool for blind students Blind students also complete mathematical assignments using a and Nemeth code a type of braille code for mathematics but large multiplication and long division problems can be long and difficult The abacus gives blind and visually impaired students a tool to compute mathematical problems that equals the speed and mathematical knowledge required by their sighted peers using pencil and paper Many blind people find this number machine a very useful tool throughout life Binary abacus The binary abacus is used to explain how computers manipulate numbers The abacus shows how numbers letters and signs can be stored in a binary system on a computer or via ASCII The device consists of a series of beads on parallel wires arranged in three separate rows The beads represent a switch on the computer in either an on or off position Thus each row may be used to represent an octal digit Below is an octal algorithm that is usable not only on this abacus but also on others if the requisite adjustments for using a different base are made
