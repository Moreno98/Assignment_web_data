Asphalt Asphalt or occasionally also known as bitumen is a sticky black and highly viscous liquid or form of petroleum It may be found in natural deposits or may be a refined product it is a substance classed as a pitch Until the century the term asphaltum was also used The word is derived from the Greek asphaltos which in turn was borrowed from an Eastern word The primary use of is in road construction where it is used as the glue or binder mixed with aggregate particles to create asphalt concrete Its other main uses are for bituminous waterproofing products including production of roofing felt and for sealing flat roofs The terms asphalt and bitumen are often used interchangeably to mean both natural and manufactured forms of the substance In American English asphalt or asphalt cement is the carefully refined residue from the distillation process of selected crude oils Outside the United States the product is often called bitumen Geological terminology often prefers the term bitumen Common usage often refers to various forms of as tar such as at the La Brea Tar Pits Another term for now rather archaic is pitch Naturally occurring is sometimes specified by the term crude bitumen Its viscosity is similar to that of cold molasses while the material obtained from the fractional distillation of crude oil boiling at is sometimes referred to as refined bitumen Composition The components of asphalt are classified into four classes of compounds The naphthene aromatics and polar aromatics are typically the majority components Additionally most natural bitumens contain organosulfur compounds resulting in an overall sulfur content of up to Nickel and vanadium are found in the ppm level as is typical of some petroleum The substance is soluble in carbon disulfide It is commonly modelled as a colloid with asphaltenes as the dispersed phase and maltenes as the continuous phase and it is almost impossible to separate and identify all the different molecules of asphalt because the number of molecules with different chemical structure is extremely large can sometimes be confused with coal tar which is a visually similar black thermoplastic material produced by the destructive distillation of coal During the early and century when town gas was produced coal tar was a readily available byproduct and extensively used as the binder for road aggregates The addition of tar to macadam roads led to the word tarmac which is now used in common parlance to refer to materials However since the when natural gas succeeded town gas has completely overtaken the use of coal tar in these applications Other examples of this confusion include the of the La Brea Tar Pits and the Canadian oil sands Pitch is another term sometimes used at times to refer to as in Pitch Lake Occurrence The great majority of asphalt used commercially is obtained from petroleum Nonetheless large amounts of asphalt occur in concentrated form in nature Naturally occurring deposits of are formed from the remains of ancient microscopic algae diatoms and other things These remains were deposited in the mud on the bottom of the ocean or lake where the organisms lived Under the heat above C and pressure of burial deep in the earth the remains were transformed into materials such as kerogen or petroleum Natural deposits of include lakes such as the Pitch Lake in Trinidad and Tobago and Lake Bermudez in Venezuela Natural seeps of occur in the La Brea Tar Pits and in the Dead Sea also occurs as impregnated sandstones known as bituminous rock and the similar tar sands such as in Athabasca Canada and Utah US The Athabasca tar sands are located in the McMurray Formation Alberta This formation is from the early Cretaceous and is composed of numerous lenses of sand with up to oil Isotopic studies attribute the oil deposits to be about Ma old Heavy oil or bitumen deposits also occur in the Uinta Basin in Utah US The Tar Sand Triangle deposit for example is roughly bitumen occurs in hydrothermal veins An example of this is within the Uinta Basin of Utah in the US where there is a swarm of laterally and vertically extensive veins composed of a solid hydrocarbon termed Gilsonite These veins formed by the polymerisation and solidification of hydrocarbons that were mobilized from the deeper oil shales of the Green River Formation during burial and diagenesis is similar to the organic matter in carbonaceous meteorites However detailed studies have shown these materials to be distinct History Ancient times The use of for waterproofing and as an adhesive dates at least to the fifth millennium in the early Indus community of Mehrgarh where it was used to line the baskets in which they gathered crops In the ancient Middle East the Sumerians used natural deposits for mortar between bricks and stones to cement parts of carvings such as eyes into place for ship caulking and for waterproofing The Greek historian Herodotus said hot was used as mortar in the walls of Babylon A tunnel beneath the river Euphrates at Babylon in the time of Queen Semiramis was reportedly constructed of burnt bricks covered with as a waterproofing agent was used by ancient Egyptians to embalm mummies The Persian word for asphalt is moom which is related to the English word mummy The Egyptians primary source of was the Dead Sea which the Romans knew as Palus Asphaltites Asphalt Lake Approximately AD Dioscorides described the Dead Sea material as Judaicum bitumen and noted other places in the region where it could be found The Sidon bitumen is thought to refer to found at Hasbeya Pliny refers also to being found in Epirus It was a valuable strategic resource the object of the first known battle for a hydrocarbon deposit between the Seleucids and the Nabateans in In the ancient Far East natural was slowly boiled to get rid of the higher fractions leaving a material of higher molecular weight which is thermoplastic and when layered on objects became quite hard upon cooling This was used to cover objects that needed waterproofing such as scabbards and other items Statuettes of household deities were also cast with this type of material in Japan and probably also in China In North America archaeological recovery has indicated was sometimes used to adhere stone projectile points to wooden shafts Early use in Europe years after the fall of Constantinople in Pierre Belon described in his work Observations in that pissasphalto a mixture of pitch and bitumen was used in Dubrovnik for tarring of ships from where it was exported to a market place in Venice where it could be bought by anyone An edition of Mechanics Magazine cites an early use of asphalt in France A pamphlet dated by a certain Monsieur states that he had discovered the existence of asphaltum in large quantities in the vicinity of Neufchatel and that he proposed to use it in a variety of ways principally in the construction of granaries and in protecting by means of the arches the in the city of Paris from the intrusion of dirt and filth which at that time made the water unusable He expatiates also on the excellence of this material for forming level and durable terraces in palaces the notion of forming such terraces in the streets not one likely to cross the brain of a Parisian of that generation But it was generally neglected in France until the revolution of Then in the there was a surge of interest and asphalt became widely used for pavements flat roofs and the lining of cisterns and in England some use of it had been made of it for similar purposes Its rise in Europe was a sudden phenomenon after natural deposits were found in France at Osbann BasRhin the Parc and the although it could also be made artificially One of the earliest uses in France was the laying of about square yards of Seyssel asphalt at the Place de la Concorde in Photography and art was used in early photographic technology In or it was used by French scientist Joseph Nic phore Ni pce to make the oldest surviving photograph from nature The was thinly coated onto a pewter plate which was then exposed in a camera Exposure to light hardened the and made it insoluble so that when it was subsequently rinsed with a solvent only the sufficiently areas remained Many hours of exposure in the camera were required making impractical for ordinary photography but from the to the it was in common use as a photoresist in the production of printing plates for various photomechanical printing processes was the nemesis of many artists during the century Although widely used for a time it ultimately proved unstable for use in oil painting especially when mixed with the most common dilutents such as linseed oil varnish and turpentine Unless thoroughly diluted never fully solidifies and will in time corrupt the other pigments with which it comes into contact The use of as a glaze to set in shadow or mixed with other colours to render a darker tone resulted in the eventual deterioration of a good many paintings those of Delacroix being just one notable example Perhaps the most famous example of the destructiveness of is Th odore G ricault Raft of the Medusa where his use of caused the brilliant colors to degenerate into dark greens and blacks and the paint and canvas to buckle Early use in the United Kingdom Among the earlier uses of in the United Kingdom was for etching William Salmon Polygraphice provides a recipe for varnish used in etching consisting of three ounces of virgin wax two ounces of mastic and one ounce of asphaltum By the fifth edition in he had included more asphaltum recipes from other sources The first British patent for the use of was Cassell patent asphalte or bitumen in Then on November Richard Tappin Claridge patented the use of Seyssel asphalt patent for use in asphalte pavement having seen it employed in France and Belgium when visiting with Frederick Walter Simms who worked with him on the introduction of asphalt to Britain Dr Lamb Phipson claims that his father Samuel Ryland Phipson a friend of Claridge was also instrumental in introducing the asphalte pavement in Indeed mastic pavements had been previously employed at Vauxhall by a competitor of Claridge but without success In Claridge obtained patents in Scotland on March and Ireland on April and in extensions were sought for all three patents by the trustees of a company previously formed by Claridge This was Claridge Patent Asphalte Company formed in for the purpose of introducing to Britain Asphalte in its natural state from the mine at Pyrimont Seysell in France and laid one of the first asphalt pavements in Whitehall Trials were made of the pavement in on the footway in Whitehall the stable at Knightsbridge Barracks and subsequently on the space at the bottom of the steps leading from Waterloo Place to James Park The formation in of Claridge Patent Asphalte Company with a distinguished list of aristocratic patrons and Marc and Isambard Brunel as respectively a trustee and consulting engineer gave an enormous impetus to the development of a British asphalt industry By the end of at least two other companies Robinson and the Bastenne company were in production with asphalt being laid as paving at Brighton Herne Bay Canterbury Kensington the Strand and a large floor area in while meantime Claridge Whitehall paving continue d in good order Indeed in there was a flurry of entrepreneurial activity over which had uses beyond paving For example asphalt could also used for flooring damp proofing in buildings and for waterproofing of various types of pools and baths with these latter themselves proliferating in the century On the London stockmarket there were various claims as to the exclusivity of asphalt quality from France Germany and England And numerous patents were granted in France with similar numbers of patent applications being denied in England due to their similarity to each other In England Claridge was the type most used in the and In Claridge Company entered into a joint venture to produce macadam with materials manufactured through a subsidiary company called Clarmac Roads Two products resulted namely Clarmac and Clarphalte with the former being manufactured by Clarmac Roads and the latter by Claridge Patent Asphalte although Clarmac was more widely used However the First World War impacted financially on the Clarmac Company which entered into liquidation in The failure of Clarmac Roads Ltd had a effect to Claridge Company which was itself compulsorily wound up ceasing operations in having invested a substantial amount of funds into the new venture both at the outset and in a subsequent attempt to save the Clarmac Company Early use in the United States The first use of in the New World was by indigenous peoples On the west coast as early as the century the Tongva Luise o and Chumash peoples collected the naturally occurring that seeped to the surface above underlying petroleum deposits All three used the substance as an adhesive It is found on many different artifacts of tools and ceremonial items For example it was used on rattles to adhere gourds or turtle shells to rattle handles It was also used in decorations Small round shell beads were often set in asphaltum to provide decorations It was used as a sealant on baskets to make them watertight for carrying water Asphaltum was used also to seal the planks on canoes Roads in the US have been paved with materials that include since at least when a street in front of the Newark NJ City Hall was paved In many cases these early pavings were made from naturally occurring bituminous rock such as at Ritchie Mines in Macfarlan in Ritchie County West Virginia from to In paving was used to pave Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington DC in time for the celebration of the national centennial was also used for flooring paving and waterproofing of baths and swimming pools during the early century following similar trends in Europe Modern use Rolled asphalt concrete The largest use of is for making asphalt concrete for road surfaces and accounts for approximately of the asphalt consumed in the United States Asphalt concrete pavement material is commonly composed of cement and aggregates stone sand and gravel Due to its highly viscous nature cement must be heated so it can be mixed with the aggregates at the asphalt mixing plant There are about asphalt concrete mixing plants in the and a similar number in Europe Due to the of roads covered in asphalt it is the most widely recycled material in the by percentage and second only to concrete by tonnage million tons of asphalt to million tons of concrete According to an industry survey conducted by the Federal Highway Administration and the National Asphalt Pavement Association and released in more than of the asphalt removed each year from road surfaces during widening and resurfacing projects is reused as part of new pavements roadbeds shoulders and embankments Roofing shingles account for most of the remaining consumption Other uses include cattle sprays treatments and waterproofing for fabrics Asphalt concrete paving is widely used in airports around the world Due to the sturdiness and ability to be repaired quickly it is widely used for runways dedicated to aircraft landing and taking off Mastic asphalt Mastic asphalt is a type of asphalt which differs from dense graded asphalt asphalt concrete in that it has a higher binder content usually around of the whole aggregate mix as opposed to rolled asphalt concrete which has only around added This thermoplastic substance is widely used in the building industry for waterproofing flat roofs and tanking underground Mastic asphalt is heated to a temperature of and is spread in layers to form an impervious barrier about thick Asphalt emulsion A number of technologies allow to be mixed at much lower temperatures These involve mixing with petroleum solvents to form cutbacks with reduced melting point or mixtures with water to turn the into an emulsion Asphalt emulsions contain up to and typically less than chemical additives There are two main types of emulsions with different affinity for aggregates cationic and anionic Asphalt emulsions are used in a wide variety of applications Chipseal involves spraying the road surface with asphalt emulsion followed by a layer of crushed rock gravel or crushed slag Slurry seal involves the creation of a mixture of asphalt emulsion and fine crushed aggregate that is spread on the surface of a road asphalt can also be made from asphalt emulsion to create pavements similar to asphalt several inches in depth and asphalt emulsions are also blended into recycled asphalt to create pavements Other uses is used to make Japan black a lacquer known especially for its use on iron and steel also is used in paint and marker inks by some graffiti supply companies primarily Molotow to increase the weather resistance and permanence of the paint ink and to make the color much darker is also used to seal some alkaline batteries during the manufacturing process Production About tons were produced in It is obtained as the heavy difficult to distill fraction Material with a boiling point greater than around C is considered asphalt Vacuum distillation separates it from the other components in crude oil such as naphtha gasoline and diesel The resulting material is typically further treated to extract small but valuable amounts of lubricants and to adjust the properties of the material to suit applications In a unit the crude asphalt is treated with either propane or butane in a supercritical phase to extract the lighter molecules which are then separated Further processing is possible by blowing the product namely reacting it with oxygen This step makes the product harder and more viscous is typically stored and transported at temperatures around Sometimes diesel oil or kerosene are mixed in before shipping to retain liquidity upon delivery these lighter materials are separated out of the mixture This mixture is often called bitumen feedstock or BFS Some dump trucks route the hot engine exhaust through pipes in the dump body to keep the material warm The backs of tippers carrying as well as some handling equipment are also commonly sprayed with a releasing agent before filling to aid release Diesel oil is no longer used as a release agent due to environmental concerns From oil sands Naturally occurring crude impregnated in sedimentary rock is the prime feed stock for petroleum production from Oil sands currently under development in Alberta Canada Canada has most of the world supply of natural covering square kilometres an area larger than England giving it the proven oil reserves in the world The Athabasca oil sands is the largest deposit in Canada and the only one accessible to surface mining although recent technological breakthroughs have resulted in deeper deposits becoming producible by in situ methods Because of oil price increases since upgrading bitumen to synthetic crude oil has become highly profitable As of Canadian crude production averaged about per day and was projected to rise to per day by The total amount of crude in Alberta which could be extracted is estimated to be about which at a rate of would last about years Alternatives and bioasphalt Although uncompetitive economically can be made from renewable resources such as sugar molasses and rice corn and potato starches can also be made from waste material by fractional distillation of used motor oil which is sometimes disposed by burning or dumping into landfills use of these results in premature cracking in colder climates resulting in roads that need to be repaved more frequently binders can be made roads absorb less heat from solar radiation and have less surface heat than darker surfaces reducing their contribution to the urban heat island effect Etymology The word asphalt is derived from the late Middle English in turn from French asphalte based on Late Latin asphalton asphaltum which is the latinisation of the Greek sphaltos sphalton a word meaning which perhaps derives from without and sfall make fall Note that in French the term asphalte is used for naturally occurring limestone deposits and for specialised manufactured products with fewer voids or greater bitumen content than the asphaltic concrete used to pave roads It is a significant fact that the first use of asphalt by the ancients was in the nature of a cement for securing or joining together various objects and it thus seems likely that the name itself was expressive of this application Specifically Herodotus mentioned that bitumen was brought to Babylon to build its gigantic fortification wall From the Greek the word passed into late Latin and thence into French asphalte and English asphaltum and asphalt The expression bitumen originated in the Sanskrit where we find the words jatu meaning pitch and meaning pitch creating pitch producing referring to coniferous or resinous trees The Latin equivalent is claimed by some to be originally pertaining to pitch and by others pixtumens exuding or bubbling pitch which was subsequently shortened to bitumen thence passing via French into English From the same root is derived the Anglo Saxon word cwidu mastix the German word Kitt cement or mastic and the old Norse word kvada Neither of the terms asphalt or bitumen should be confused with tar or coal tars Modern usage In British English the word asphalt is used to refer to a mixture of mineral aggregate and also called tarmac in common parlance The earlier word asphaltum is now archaic and not commonly used In American English asphalt is equivalent to the British bitumen However asphalt is also commonly used as a shortened form of asphalt concrete therefore equivalent to the British asphalt or tarmac In Australian English bitumen is often used as the generic term for road surfaces In Canadian English the word bitumen is used to refer to the vast Canadian deposits of extremely heavy crude oil while asphalt is used for the oil refinery product used to pave roads and manufacture roof shingles and various waterproofing products Diluted bitumen diluted with naphtha to make it flow in pipelines is known as dilbit in the Canadian petroleum industry while bitumen upgraded to synthetic crude oil is known as syncrude and syncrude blended with bitumen as synbit Bitumen is still the preferred geological term for naturally occurring deposits of the solid or form of petroleum Bituminous rock is a form of sandstone impregnated with bitumen The tar sands of Alberta Canada are a similar material
