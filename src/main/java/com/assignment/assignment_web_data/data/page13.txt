International Atomic Time International Atomic Time TAI from the French name is a atomic coordinate time standard based on the notional passage of proper time on Earth geoid It is the basis for Coordinated Universal Time UTC which is used for civil timekeeping all over the Earth surface and for Terrestrial Time which is used for astronomical calculations Since June when the last leap second was added TAI has been exactly seconds ahead of UTC The seconds results from the initial difference of seconds at the start of plus leap seconds in UTC since Time coordinates on the TAI scales are conventionally specified using traditional means of specifying days carried over from time standards based on the rotation of the Earth Specifically both Julian Dates and the Gregorian calendar are used TAI in this form was synchronised with Universal Time at the beginning of and the two have drifted apart ever since due to the changing motion of the Earth Operation TAI as a time scale is a weighted average of the time kept by over atomic clocks as of April in over national laboratories worldwide The clocks are compared using GPS signals and satellite time and frequency transfer Due to the averaging it is far more stable than any clock would be alone see signal averaging for a discussion The majority of the clocks are caesium clocks the definition of the SI second is written in terms of caesium The participating institutions each broadcast in real time a frequency signal with timecodes which is their estimate of TAI Time codes are usually published in the form of UTC which differs from TAI by a integer number of seconds These time scales are denoted in the form UTC NPL in the UTC form where NPL in this case identifies the National Physical Laboratory UK The TAI form may be denoted TAI NPL The latter is not to be confused with TA NPL which denotes an independent atomic time scale not synchronised to TAI or to anything else The clocks at different institutions are regularly compared against each other The International Bureau of Weights and Measures BIPM France combines these measurements to retrospectively calculate the weighted average that forms the most stable time scale possible This combined time scale is published monthly in Circular T and is the canonical TAI This time scale is expressed in the form of tables of differences k equivalent to k for each participating institution k The same circular also gives tables of k for the various unsynchronised atomic time scales Errors in publication may be corrected by issuing a revision of the faulty Circular T or by errata in a subsequent Circular Aside from this once published in Circular T the TAI scale is not revised In hindsight it is possible to discover errors in TAI and to make better estimates of the true proper time scale Doing so does not create another version of TAI it is instead considered to be creating a better realisation of Terrestrial Time TT History Early atomic time scales consisted of quartz clocks with frequencies calibrated by a single atomic clock the atomic clocks were not operated continuously Atomic timekeeping services started experimentally in using the first caesium atomic clock at the National Physical Laboratory UK NPL The Greenwich Atomic GA scale began in at the Royal Greenwich Observatory The International Time Bureau BIH began a time scale Tm or AM in July using both local caesium clocks and comparisons to distant clocks using the phase of VLF radio signals The United States Naval Observatory began the scale September using an Atomichron commercial atomic clock followed by the scale at the National Bureau of Standards Boulder Colorado Both the BIH scale and was defined by an epoch at the beginning of it was set to read Julian Date January at the corresponding instant The procedures used by the BIH evolved and the name for the time scale changed in and TA BIH in This synchronisation was inevitably imperfect depending as it did on the astronomical realisation of At the time as published by various observatories differed by several hundredths of a second In UTC began UTC is a discontinuous time scale composed from segments that are linear transformations of atomic time the discontinuities being arranged so that UTC approximated until the end of and thereafter This was a compromise arrangement for a broadcast time scale a linear transformation of the BIH atomic time meant that the time scale was stable and internationally synchronised while approximating means that tasks such as navigation which require a source of Universal Time continue to be well served by public time broadcasts The SI second was defined in terms of the caesium atom in and in the name International Atomic Time TAI was assigned to a time scale based on SI seconds with no leap seconds During this time irregularities in the atomic time were detected and corrected In it was suggested that nearby masses caused clocks to operate at different rates but this was disproven in In the it became clear that the clocks participating in TAI were ticking at different rates due to gravitational time dilation and the combined TAI scale therefore corresponded to an average of the altitudes of the various clocks Starting from Julian Date January corrections were applied to the output of all participating clocks so that TAI would correspond to proper time at mean sea level the geoid Because the clocks had been on average well above sea level this meant that TAI slowed down by about The former uncorrected time scale continues to be published under the name EAL Echelle Atomique Libre meaning Free Atomic Scale The instant that the gravitational correction started to be applied serves as the epoch for Barycentric Coordinate Time TCB Geocentric Coordinate Time TCG and Terrestrial Time TT All three of these time scales were defined to read JD January exactly at that instant The offset is to provide continuity with the older Ephemeris Time TAI was henceforth a realisation of TT with the equation TT TAI TAI s The continued existence of TAI was questioned in a letter from the BIPM to the which stated In the case of a redefinition of UTC without leap seconds the CCTF would consider discussing the possibility of suppressing TAI as it would remain parallel to the continuous UTC
