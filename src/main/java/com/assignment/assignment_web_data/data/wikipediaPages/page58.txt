Astronaut An astronaut or cosmonaut is a person trained by a human spaceflight program to command pilot or serve as a crew member of a spacecraft Although generally reserved for professional space travelers the terms are sometimes applied to anyone who travels into space including scientists politicians journalists and tourists Starting in the up to astronauts were sponsored and trained exclusively by governments either by the military or by civilian space agencies With the suborbital flight of the privately funded SpaceShipOne in a new category of astronaut was created the commercial astronaut Definition The criteria for what constitutes human spaceflight vary The F d ration A ronautique Internationale FAI Sporting Code for astronautics recognizes only flights that exceed an altitude of In the United States professional military and commercial astronauts who travel above an altitude of are awarded astronaut wings a total of people from countries have reached or more in altitude of which reached low Earth orbit or beyond Of these people have traveled beyond Low Earth orbit to either lunar or orbit or to the surface of the moon three of the did so twice Jim Lovell John Young and Eugene Cernan The three astronauts who have not reached low Earth orbit are spaceplane pilots Joe Walker Mike Melvill and Brian Binnie under the definition people qualify as having reached space above altitude Of eight pilots who exceeded in altitude only one exceeded kilometers about miles Space travelers have spent over in space including over of spacewalks As of the man with the longest cumulative time in space is Sergei Krikalev who has spent days hours and minutes or years in space Peggy Whitson holds the record for the most time in space by a woman days Terminology English In nations a professional space traveler is called an astronaut The term derives from the Greek words stron meaning star and nautes meaning sailor The first known use of the term astronaut in the modern sense was by Neil Jones in his short story The Death Head Meteor in The word itself had been known earlier For example in Percy Greg book Across the Zodiac astronaut referred to a spacecraft In Les Navigateurs de of Rosny a n the word astronautique astronautic was used The word may have been inspired by aeronaut an older term for an air traveler first applied in to balloonists An early use in a publication is Eric Frank Russell poem The Astronaut in the November Bulletin of the British Interplanetary Society The first known formal use of the term astronautics in the scientific community was the establishment of the annual International Astronautical Congress in and the subsequent founding of the International Astronautical Federation the following year NASA applies the term astronaut to any crew member aboard NASA spacecraft bound for Earth orbit or beyond NASA also uses the term as a title for those selected to join its Astronaut Corps The European Space Agency similarly uses the term astronaut for members of its Astronaut Corps Russian By convention an astronaut employed by the Russian Federal Space Agency or its Soviet predecessor is called a cosmonaut in English texts The word is an anglicisation of the Russian word kosmonavt one who works in space outside the Earth atmosphere a space traveler which derives from the Greek words kosmos meaning universe and nautes meaning sailor Other countries of the former Eastern Bloc use variations of the Russian word kosmonavt such as the Polish kosmonauta The Soviet Air Force pilot Yuri Gagarin was the first cosmonaut indeed the first person in space Valentina Tereshkova a Russian factory worker was the first woman in space as well as arguably the second civilian to make it there see below for a further discussion of civilians in space On March Norman Thagard became the first American to ride to space on board a Russian launch vehicle and thus became the first American cosmonaut Chinese Official texts issued by the government of China use astronaut while texts in Russian use cosmonaut In official texts y h ng yu n space navigating personnel is used for astronauts and cosmonauts and h ng ti n yu n space navigating personnel is used for Chinese astronauts The phrase t i k ng r n spaceman is often used in Hong Kong and Taiwan The term taikonaut is used by some news media organizations for professional space travelers from China The word has featured in the Longman and Oxford English dictionaries the latter of which describes it as a hybrid of the Chinese term taikong space and the Greek naut sailor the term became more common in when China sent its first astronaut Yang Liwei into space aboard the Shenzhou spacecraft This is the term used by Xinhua News Agency in the English version of the Chinese People Daily since the advent of the Chinese space program The origin of the term is unclear as early as May Chiew Lee Yih from Malaysia used it in newsgroups Other terms With the rise of space tourism NASA and the Russian Federal Space Agency agreed to use the term spaceflight participant to distinguish those space travelers from professional astronauts on missions coordinated by those two agencies While no nation other than the Russian Federation and previously the former Soviet Union the United States and China have launched a manned spacecraft several other nations have sent people into space in cooperation with one of these countries Inspired partly by these missions other synonyms for astronaut have entered occasional English usage For example the term spationaut French spelling spationaute is sometimes used to describe French space travelers from the Latin word spatium for space the Malay term angkasawan was used to describe participants in the Angkasawan program and the Indian Space Research Organization hope to launch a spacecraft in that would carry vyomanauts coined from the Sanskrit word for space Space travel milestones The first human in space was Soviet Yuri Gagarin who was launched on April aboard Vostok and orbited around the Earth for minutes The first woman in space was Soviet Valentina Tereshkova who launched on June aboard Vostok and orbited Earth for almost three days Alan Shepard became the first American and second person in space on May on a flight The first American woman in space was Sally Ride during Space Shuttle Challenger mission on June In Mae Jemison became the first African American woman to travel in space aboard Cosmonaut Alexei Leonov was the first person to conduct an extravehicular activity EVA commonly called a spacewalk on March on the Soviet Union Voskhod mission This was followed two and a half months later by astronaut Ed White who made the first American EVA on NASA Gemini mission The first manned mission to orbit the Moon Apollo included American William Anders who was born in Hong Kong making him the first astronaut in The Soviet Union through its Intercosmos program allowed people from other socialist Warsaw Pact and other countries to fly on its missions with the notable exception of France participating in Soyuz An example is Czechoslovak Vladim r Remek the first cosmonaut from a country other than the Soviet Union or the United States who flew to space in on a rocket On July Pham Tuan of Vietnam became the first Asian in space when he flew aboard Soyuz Also in Cuban Arnaldo Tamayo M ndez became the first person of Hispanic and black African descent to fly in space and in Guion Bluford became the first African American to fly into space In April Taylor Wang became the first ethnic Chinese person in space The first person born in Africa to fly in space was Patrick Baudry France in In Saudi Arabian Prince Sultan Bin Salman Bin AbdulAziz became the first Arab Muslim astronaut in space In Abdul Ahad Mohmand became the first Afghan to reach space spending nine days aboard the Mir space station With the larger number of seats available on the Space Shuttle the began taking international astronauts In Ulf Merbold of West Germany became the first citizen to fly in a US spacecraft In Marc Garneau became the first of Canadian astronauts to fly in space through In Rodolfo Neri Vela became the first person in space In Helen Sharman became the first Briton to fly in space In Mark Shuttleworth became the first citizen of an African country to fly in space as a paying spaceflight participant In Ilan Ramon became the first Israeli to fly in space although he died during a accident On October Yang Liwei became China first astronaut on the Shenzhou spacecraft Age milestones The youngest person to fly in space is Gherman Titov who was years old when he flew Vostok Titov was also the first person to suffer space sickness The oldest person who has flown in space is John Glenn who was when he flew on Duration and distance milestones The longest stay in space thus far has been days by Russian Valeri Polyakov As of the most spaceflights by an individual astronaut is seven a record held by both Jerry Ross and Franklin The farthest distance from Earth an astronaut has traveled was when Jim Lovell Jack Swigert and Fred Haise went around the Moon during the Apollo emergency Civilian and milestones Depending on the exact definition of civilian the first civilian in space was either Valentina Tereshkova aboard Vostok she also became the first woman in space on that mission or Joseph Albert Walker on Flight a month later Tereshkova was only honorarily inducted into the USSR Air Force which had no female pilots whatsoever at that time Joe Walker had joined the US Army Air Force but was not a member during his flight The first people in space who had never been a member of any country armed forces were both Konstantin Feoktistov and Boris Yegorov aboard Voskhod The first space traveler was Byron Lichtenberg a researcher from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who flew on in In December Toyohiro Akiyama became the first paying space traveler as a reporter for Tokyo Broadcasting System a visit to Mir as part of an estimated million USD deal with a Japanese TV station although at the time the term used to refer to Akiyama was Research Cosmonaut Akiyama suffered severe space sickness during his mission which affected his productivity The first space tourist was Dennis Tito on board the Russian spacecraft Soyuz on April travelers The first person to fly on an entirely privately funded mission was Mike Melvill piloting SpaceShipOne flight on a suborbital journey although he was a test pilot employed by Scaled Composites and not an actual paying space tourist Seven others have paid to Russian Space Agency to fly into space Training The first NASA astronauts were selected for training in Early in the space program military jet test piloting and engineering training were often cited as prerequisites for selection as an astronaut at NASA although neither John Glenn nor Scott Carpenter of the Mercury Seven had any university degree in engineering or any other discipline at the time of their selection Selection was initially limited to military pilots The earliest astronauts for both America and the USSR tended to be jet fighter pilots and were often test pilots Once selected NASA astronauts go through twenty months of training in a variety of areas including training for extravehicular activity in a facility such as NASA Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory may also experience short periods of weightlessness in aircraft called the vomit comet the nickname given to a pair of modified retired in and respectively and replaced in with a which perform parabolic flights Astronauts are also required to accumulate a number of flight hours in jet aircraft This is mostly done in jet aircraft out of Ellington Field due to its proximity to the Johnson Space Center Ellington Field is also where the Shuttle Training Aircraft is maintained and developed although most flights of the aircraft are done out of Edwards Air Force Base NASA candidacy requirements Mission Specialist Educator Mission Specialist Educators or Educator Astronauts were first selected in and as of there are three NASA Educator astronauts Joseph Acaba Richard Arnold and Dorothy Barbara Morgan selected as teacher to Christa McAuliffe in is considered to be the first Educator astronaut by the media but she trained as a mission specialist The Educator Astronaut program is a successor to the Teacher in Space program from the Health risks of space travel Astronauts are susceptible to a variety of health risks including decompression sickness barotrauma immunodeficiencies loss of bone and muscle loss of eyesight orthostatic intolerance sleep disturbances and radiation injury A variety of large scale medical studies are being conducted in space via the National Space and Biomedical Research Institute NSBRI to address these issues Prominent among these is the Advanced Diagnostic Ultrasound in Microgravity Study in which astronauts including former ISS commanders Leroy Chiao and Gennady Padalka perform ultrasound scans under the guidance of remote experts to diagnose and potentially treat hundreds of medical conditions in space This study techniques are now being applied to cover professional and Olympic sports injuries as well as ultrasound performed by operators in medical and high school students It is anticipated that remote guided ultrasound will have application on Earth in emergency and rural care situations where access to a trained physician is often rare On December a study reported that manned spaceflight may harm the brain and accelerate the onset of Alzheimer disease Food and drink An astronaut on the International Space Station requires about kilograms pounds weight of food inclusive of food packaging per meal each day The packaging for each meal weighs around kilograms pounds missions require more food Shuttle astronauts worked with nutritionists to select menus that appeal to their individual tastes Five months before flight menus are selected and analyzed for nutritional content by the shuttle dietician Foods are tested to see how they will react in a reduced gravity environment Caloric requirements are determined using a basal energy expenditure BEE formula On Earth the average American uses about gallons liters of water every day On board the ISS astronauts limit water use to only about three gallons liters per day Insignia In Russia cosmonauts are awarded of the Russian Federation upon completion of their missions often accompanied with the award of Hero of the Russian Federation This follows the practice established in the USSR where cosmonauts were usually awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union At NASA those who complete astronaut candidate training receive a silver lapel pin Once they have flown in space they receive a gold pin astronauts who also have military status receive a special qualification badge known as the Astronaut Badge after participation on a spaceflight The United States Air Force also presents an Astronaut Badge to its pilots who exceed in altitude Deaths Eighteen astronauts fourteen men and four women have lost their lives during four space flights By nationality thirteen were American including one of Indian origin four were Russian Soviet Union and one was Israeli Eleven people all men have lost their lives training for spaceflight eight Americans and three Russians Six of these were in crashes of training jet aircraft one drowned during water recovery training and four were due to fires in pure oxygen environments The Space Mirror Memorial which stands on the grounds of the John Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex commemorates the lives of the men and women who have died during spaceflight and during training in the space programs of the United States In addition to twenty NASA career astronauts the memorial includes the names of a Air Force test pilot a Air Force officer who died while training for a military space program and a civilian spaceflight participant
