Huxley mother died in when he was In he suffered an illness keratitis punctata which left practically blind for two to three years Aldous volunteered to join the army at the outbreak of World War I but was rejected on health grounds he was in one eye Once his eyesight recovered sufficiently he was able to study English literature at Balliol College Oxford In he edited Oxford Poetry and later graduated with first class honours His brother Julian wrote I believe his blindness was a blessing in disguise For one thing it put paid to his idea of taking up medicine as a career His uniqueness lay in his universalism He was able to take all knowledge for his province Following his education at Balliol Huxley was financially indebted to his father and had to earn a living He taught French for a year at Eton where Eric Blair later to become George Orwell and Steven Runciman were among his pupils but was remembered as an incompetent and hopeless teacher who could keep discipline Nevertheless Blair and others were impressed by his use of words For a short while in he was employed acquiring provisions at the Air Ministry Significantly Huxley also worked for a time in the at the technologically advanced Brunner and Mond chemical plant in Billingham Teesside and the most recent introduction to his famous science fiction novel Brave New World states that this experience of an ordered universe in a world of planless incoherence was one source for the novel Career Huxley completed his first unpublished novel at the age of and began writing seriously in his early His first published novels were social satires beginning with Crome Yellow Bloomsbury Set During World War I Huxley spent much of his time at Garsington Manor near Oxford home of Lady Ottoline Morrell working as a farm labourer Here he met several Bloomsbury figures including Bertrand Russell Alfred North Whitehead and Clive Bell Later in Crome Yellow he caricatured the Garsington lifestyle Jobs were very scarce but in John Middleton Murry was reorganising the Athenaeum and invited Huxley to join the staff He accepted immediately and quickly married the Belgian refugee Maria Nys also at Garsington They lived with their young son in Italy part of the time in the where Huxley would visit his friend Lawrence Following Lawrence death in Huxley edited Lawrence letters Works of this period included important novels on the dehumanising aspects of scientific progress most famously Brave New World and on pacifist themes for example Eyeless in Gaza In Brave New World set in a dystopian London Huxley portrays a society operating on the principles of mass production and Pavlovian conditioning Huxley was strongly influenced by Matthias Alexander and included him as a character in Eyeless in Gaza Starting from this period Huxley began to write and edit works on pacifist issues including Ends and Means An Encyclopedia of Pacifism and Pacifism and Philosophy and was an active member of the Peace Pledge Union United States In Huxley moved to Hollywood with his wife Maria son Matthew and friend Gerald Heard He lived in the United States mainly in southern California until his death but also for a time in Taos New Mexico where he wrote Ends and Means published in In this work he examines the fact that although most people in modern civilisation agree that they want a world of liberty peace justice and brotherly love they have not been able to agree on how to achieve it Heard introduced Huxley to Vedanta philosophy meditation and vegetarianism through the principle of ahimsa In Huxley befriended Jiddu Krishnamurti whose teachings he greatly admired He also became a Vedantist in the circle of Hindu Swami Prabhavananda and introduced Christopher Isherwood to this circle Not long after Huxley wrote his book on widely held spiritual values and ideas The Perennial Philosophy which discussed the teachings of renowned mystics of the world Huxley book affirmed a sensibility that insists there are realities beyond the generally accepted five senses and that there is genuine meaning for humans beyond both sensual satisfactions and sentimentalities Huxley became a close friend of Remsen Bird president of Occidental College He spent much time at the college which is in the Eagle Rock neighbourhood of Los Angeles The college appears as Tarzana College in his satirical novel After Many a Summer The novel won Huxley that year James Tait Black Memorial Prize for fiction Huxley also incorporated Bird into the novel During this period Huxley earned a substantial income as a Hollywood screenwriter Christopher Isherwood in his autobiography My Guru and His Disciple states that Huxley earned over per week an enormous sum in those days as a screenwriter and that he used much of it to bring over Jewish and writer and artist refugees from Hitler Germany to the In March his friend Anita Loos a novelist and screenwriter put him in touch with who hired Huxley for Madame Curie which was originally to star Greta Garbo and be directed by George Cukor The film was eventually completed by MGM in with a different director and cast Huxley received screen credit for Pride and Prejudice and was paid for his work on a number of other films including Jane Eyre Huxley wrote an introduction to the posthumous publication of Unwin book Hopousia or The Sexual and Economic Foundations of a New Society On October Huxley wrote to George Orwell author of Nineteen congratulating him on how fine and how profoundly important the book is In his letter to Orwell he predicted Within the next generation I believe that the world leaders will discover that infant conditioning and are more efficient as instruments of government than clubs and prisons and that the lust for power can be just as completely satisfied by suggesting people into loving their servitude as by flogging them and kicking them into obedience Huxley had deeply felt apprehensions about the future the developed world might make for itself From these he made some warnings in his writings and talks In a televised interview conducted by journalist Mike Wallace Huxley outlined several major concerns the difficulties and dangers of world overpopulation the tendency toward distinctly hierarchical social organisation the crucial importance of evaluating the use of technology in mass societies susceptible to wily persuasion the tendency to promote modern politicians to a naive public as commodities Post World War II After World War II Huxley applied for United States citizenship His application was continuously deferred on the grounds that he would not say he would take up arms to defend the He claimed a philosophical rather than a religious objection and therefore was not exempt under the McCarran Act He withdrew his application Nevertheless he remained in the country and in he turned down an offer of a Knight Bachelor by the Macmillan government Association with Vedanta Beginning in and continuing until his death in Huxley had an extensive association with the Vedanta Society of Southern California founded and headed by Swami Prabhavananda Together with Gerald Heard Christopher Isherwood and other followers he was initiated by the Swami and was taught meditation and spiritual practices In Huxley wrote the introduction to the Bhagavad Gita The Song of God translated by Swami Prabhavanada and Christopher Isherwood which was published by The Vedanta Society of Southern California From until Huxley contributed articles to Vedanta and the West published by the Society He also served on the editorial board with Isherwood Heard and playwright John van Druten from through Huxley also occasionally lectured at the Hollywood and Santa Barbara Vedanta temples Two of those lectures have been released on CD Knowledge and Understanding and Who Are We from Nonetheless Huxley agnosticism together with his speculative propensity made it difficult for him to fully embrace any form of institutionalized religion After the publication of The Doors of Perception Huxley and the Swami disagreed about the meaning and importance of the LSD drug experience which may have caused the relationship to cool but Huxley continued to write articles for the Society journal lecture at the temple and attend social functions Eyesight There are differing accounts about the details of the quality of Huxley eyesight at specific points in his life Around Huxley encountered the Bates method for better eyesight and a teacher Margaret Darst Corbett who was able to teach him in the method In Huxley relocated from Hollywood to a ranchito in the high desert hamlet of Llano California in northernmost Los Angeles County Huxley then said that his sight improved dramatically with the Bates Method and the extreme and pure natural lighting of the southwestern American desert He reported that for the first time in over years he was able to read without glasses and without strain He even tried driving a car along the dirt road beside the ranch He wrote a book about his successes with the Bates Method The Art of Seeing which was published in US UK The book contained some generally disputed theories and its publication created a growing degree of popular controversy about Huxley eyesight It was and is widely believed that Huxley was nearly blind since the illness in his teens despite the partial recovery which had enabled him to study at Oxford For example some ten years after publication of The Art of Seeing in Bennett Cerf was present when Huxley spoke at a Hollywood banquet wearing no glasses and apparently reading his paper from the lectern without difficulty Then suddenly he faltered and the disturbing truth became obvious He was reading his address at all He had learned it by heart To refresh his memory he brought the paper closer and closer to his eyes When it was only an inch or so away he still could read it and had to fish for a magnifying glass in his pocket to make the typing visible to him It was an agonising moment On the other hand Huxley second wife Laura Archera Huxley would later emphasise in her biographical account This Timeless Moment One of the great achievements of his life that of having regained his sight After revealing a letter she wrote to the Los Angeles Times disclaiming the label of Huxley as a poor fellow who can hardly see by Walter Alvarez she tempered this Although I feel it was an injustice to treat Aldous as though he were blind it is true there were many indications of his impaired vision For instance although Aldous did not wear glasses he would quite often use a magnifying lens Laura Huxley proceeded to elaborate a few nuances of inconsistency peculiar to Huxley vision Her account in this respect is discernibly congruent with the following sample of Huxley own words from The Art of Seeing The most characteristic fact about the functioning of the total organism or any part of the organism is that it is not constant but highly variable Nevertheless the topic of Huxley eyesight continues to endure similar significant controversy regardless of how trivial a subject matter it might initially appear American popular science author Steven Johnson in his book Mind Wide Open quotes Huxley about his difficulties with visual encoding I am and for as long as I can remember I have always been a poor visualizer Words even the pregnant words of poets do not evoke pictures in my mind No hypnagogic visions greet me on the verge of sleep When I recall something the memory does not present itself to me as a vividly seen event or object By an effort of the will I can evoke a not very vivid image of what happened yesterday afternoon Huxley The Doors of Perception and Heaven and Hell HarperPerennial Personal life Huxley married Maria Nys September February a Belgian he met at Garsington in They had one child Matthew Huxley April February who had a career as an author anthropologist and prominent epidemiologist In Huxley married Laura Archera also an author She wrote This Timeless Moment a biography of Huxley Laura felt inspired to illuminate the story of their provocative marriage through Mary Ann Braubach documentary Huxley on Huxley In Huxley was diagnosed with laryngeal cancer and in the years that followed with his health deteriorating he wrote the Utopian novel Island and gave lectures on Human Potentialities both at the University of California San Francisco Medical Center and at the Esalen Institute which lectures were fundamental to the beginning of the Human Potential Movement Huxley was a close friend of Jiddu Krishnamurti and Rosalind Rajagopal and was involved in the creation of the Happy Valley School now Besant Hill School of Happy Valley in Ojai California The most substantial collection of Huxley few remaining papers following the destruction of most in a fire is at the Library of the University of California Los Angeles Some are also at the Stanford University Libraries Death On his deathbed unable to speak due to advanced laryngeal cancer Huxley made a written request to his wife Laura for LSD g intramuscular According to her account of his death in This Timeless Moment she obliged with an injection at and a second dose a few hours later Huxley died aged at on November Media coverage of Huxley passing as with that of the author Lewis was overshadowed by the assassination of President John Kennedy on the same day This coincidence was the inspiration for Peter Kreeft book Between Heaven and Hell A Dialog Somewhere Beyond Death with John Kennedy Lewis Aldous Huxley Huxley ashes were interred in the family grave at the Watts Cemetery home of the Watts Mortuary Chapel in Compton a village near Guildford Surrey England On July a commemorative bench was unveiled there donated by the Aldous and Laura Huxley Literary Trust and the International Aldous Huxley Society Huxley had been a friend of famous Russian composer Igor Stravinsky who later dedicated his last orchestral composition to Huxley Stravinsky began Variations in Santa F New Mexico in July and completed the composition in Hollywood on October It was first performed in Chicago on April by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra conducted by Robert Craft Spies White White Huxley literary legacy continues to be represented by the literary agency headed by Georges Borchardt
