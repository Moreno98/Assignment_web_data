Apollo Apollo the second human spaceflight mission in the United States Apollo space program was launched on December and became the first manned spacecraft to leave Earth orbit reach the Earth Moon orbit it and return safely to Earth The crew Commander Frank Borman Command Module Pilot James Lovell and Lunar Module Pilot William Anders became the first humans to travel beyond low Earth orbit the first to see Earth as a whole planet the first to directly see the far side of the Moon and then the first to witness Earthrise The mission the third flight of the Saturn V rocket and that rocket first manned launch was also the first human spaceflight launch from the Kennedy Space Center Florida located adjacent to Cape Canaveral Air Force Station The mission was originally planned as Apollo to be performed in early as the second test of the complete Apollo spacecraft including the Lunar Module and the Module in an elliptical medium Earth orbit But when the Lunar Module proved unready to make its first test in a lower Earth orbit in December it was decided in August to fly Apollo in December as a more ambitious lunar orbital flight without the Lunar Module This meant Borman crew was scheduled to fly two to three months sooner than originally planned leaving them a shorter time for training and preparation thus placing more demands than usual on their time and discipline Apollo took three days to travel to the Moon It orbited ten times over the course of hours during which the crew made a Christmas Eve television broadcast where they read the first verses from the Book of Genesis At the time the broadcast was the most watched TV program ever Apollo successful mission paved the way for Apollo to fulfill President John Kennedy goal of landing a man on the Moon before the end of the The Apollo astronauts returned to Earth on December when their spacecraft splashed down in the Northern Pacific Ocean The crew was named Time magazine Men of the Year for upon their return Crew Lovell was originally the CMP on the crew with Michael Collins as the prime crew CMP However Collins was replaced in July after suffering a cervical disc herniation that required surgery to repair This crew was unique among era missions in that the commander was not the most experienced member of the crew as Lovell had flown twice before on Gemini VII and Gemini XII This was also the first case of the rarity of an astronaut who had commanded a spaceflight mission subsequently flying as a as Lovell had previously commanded Gemini XII Backup crew On a lunar mission the Command Module Pilot CMP was assigned the role of navigator while the Lunar Module Pilot LMP was assigned the role of flight engineer responsible for monitoring all spacecraft systems even if the flight did include a Lunar Module Edwin Aldrin was originally the backup LMP When Lovell was rotated to the prime crew no one with experience on the specific spacecraft used for the mission was available so Aldrin was moved to CMP and Fred Haise brought in as backup LMP Neil Armstrong went on to command Apollo where Aldrin was returned to the LMP position and Collins was assigned as CMP Haise was rotated out of the crew and onto the backup crew of Apollo as LMP Mission control The mission control teams for Apollo consisted of astronauts assigned to the support crew as well as flight directors and their staffs The support crew members were not trained to fly the mission but were able to stand in for astronauts in meetings and be involved in the minutiae of mission planning while the prime and backup crews trained They also served as CAPCOMs during the mission For Apollo these crew members included astronauts John Bull Vance Brand Gerald Carr and Ken Mattingly The mission control teams on Earth rotated in three shifts each led by a flight director The directors for Apollo included Clifford Charlesworth Green team Glynn Lunney Black team and Milton Windler Maroon team Mission insignia The triangular shape of the insignia symbolizes the shape of the Apollo Command Module CM It shows a red looping around the Earth and Moon representing the mission number as well as the circumlunar nature of the mission On the red number are the names of the three astronauts The initial design of the insignia was developed by Jim Lovell Lovell reportedly sketched the initial design while riding in the backseat of a flight from California to Houston shortly after learning of the of the flight to become a mission The graphic design of the insignia was done by Houston artist and animator William Bradley Planning Apollo and Apollo had been A missions unmanned tests of the Saturn V launch vehicle using an unmanned Block I production model of the Apollo Command and Service Module in Earth orbit scheduled for October would be a manned flight of the CSM completing the objectives for Mission Further missions depended on the readiness of the Lunar Module Apollo was planned as the D mission to test the LM in a low Earth orbit in December by James McDivitt David Scott and Russell Schweickart while Borman crew would fly the E mission a more rigorous LM test in an elliptical medium Earth orbit as Apollo in early But production of the LM fell behind schedule and when Apollo LM arrived at Cape Canaveral in June significant defects were discovered leading Grumman the lead contractor for the LM to predict that the first LM would not be ready until at least February This would mean delaying the D and subsequent missions endangering the program goal of a lunar landing before the end of George Low the Manager of the Apollo Spacecraft Program Office proposed a solution in August to keep the program on track despite the LM delay Since the Module CSM would be ready three months before the Lunar Module a mission could be flown in December Instead of just repeating the C mission flight of Apollo this CSM could be sent all the way to the Moon with the possibility of entering a lunar orbit The new mission would also allow NASA to test lunar landing procedures that would otherwise have to wait until Apollo the scheduled F mission This also meant that the medium Earth orbit E mission could be dispensed with The net result was that only the D mission had to be delayed Almost every senior manager at NASA agreed with this new mission citing both confidence in the hardware and personnel and the potential for a significant morale boost provided by a circumlunar flight The only person who needed some convincing was James Webb the NASA administrator With the rest of his agency in support of the new mission Webb eventually approved the mission change The mission was officially changed from a D mission to a mission but was still referred to in press releases as an mission at Webb direction No public announcement was made about the change in mission until November three weeks after Apollo successful mission and less than days before launch With the change in mission for Apollo Director of Flight Crew Operations Deke Slayton decided to swap the crews of the D and E missions This swap also meant a swap of spacecraft requiring Borman crew to use while McDivitt crew would use On September the crew entered the simulators to begin their preparation for the flight By the time the mission flew the crew had spent seven hours training for every actual hour of flight Although all crew members were trained in all aspects of the mission it was necessary to specialize Borman as commander was given training on controlling the spacecraft during the Lovell was trained on navigating the spacecraft in case communication was lost with the Earth Anders was placed in charge of checking that the spacecraft was in working order Added pressure on the Apollo program to make its landing goal was provided by the Soviet Union flight of some living creatures including Russian tortoises in a cislunar loop around the Moon on Zond and return to Earth on September There was speculation within NASA and the press that they might be preparing to launch cosmonauts on a similar circumlunar mission before the end of The Apollo crew now living in the crew quarters at Kennedy Space Center received a visit from Charles Lindbergh and his wife Anne Morrow Lindbergh the night before the launch They talked about how before his flight Lindbergh had used a piece of string to measure the distance from New York City to Paris on a globe and from that calculated the fuel needed for the flight The total was a tenth of the amount that the Saturn V would burn every second The next day the Lindberghs watched the launch of Apollo from a nearby dune Saturn V The Saturn V rocket used by Apollo was designated or the model of the Saturn V Rocket to be used in the SA program When it was erected in the Vertical Assembly Building on December it was thought that the rocket would be used for an unmanned test flight carrying a boilerplate Module Apollo had suffered several major problems during its April flight including severe pogo oscillation during its first stage two second stage engine failures and a third stage that failed to reignite in orbit Without assurances that these problems had been rectified NASA administrators could not justify risking a manned mission until additional unmanned test flights proved that the Saturn V was ready Teams from the Marshall Space Flight Center MSFC went to work on the problems Of primary concern was the pogo oscillation which would not only hamper engine performance but could exert significant on a crew A task force of contractors NASA agency representatives and MSFC researchers concluded that the engines vibrated at a frequency similar to the frequency at which the spacecraft itself vibrated causing a resonance effect that induced oscillations in the rocket A system using helium gas to absorb some of these vibrations was installed Of equal importance was the failure of three engines during flight Researchers quickly determined that a leaking hydrogen fuel line ruptured when exposed to vacuum causing a loss of fuel pressure in engine two When an automatic shutoff attempted to close the liquid hydrogen valve and shut down engine two it accidentally shut down engine three liquid oxygen due to a miswired connection As a result engine three failed within one second of engine two shutdown Further investigation revealed the same problem for the engine a faulty igniter line The team modified the igniter lines and fuel conduits hoping to avoid similar problems on future launches The teams tested their solutions in August at the Marshall Space Flight Center A Saturn stage IC was equipped with shock absorbing devices to demonstrate the team solution to the problem of pogo oscillation while a Saturn Stage II was retrofitted with modified fuel lines to demonstrate their resistance to leaks and ruptures in vacuum conditions Once NASA administrators were convinced that the problems were solved they gave their approval for a manned mission using The Apollo spacecraft was placed on top of the rocket on September and the rocket made the slow km journey to the launch pad on October Testing continued all through December until the day before launch including various levels of readiness testing from December through Final testing of modifications to address the problems of pogo oscillation ruptured fuel lines and bad igniter lines took place on December a mere three days before the scheduled launch Mission Parameter summary As the first manned spacecraft to orbit more than one celestial body Apollo profile had two different sets of orbital parameters separated by a translunar injection maneuver Apollo lunar missions would begin with a nominal circular Earth parking orbit Apollo was launched into an initial orbit with an apogee of and a perigee of with an inclination of to the Equator and an orbital period of minutes Propellant venting increased the apogee by over the hours minutes and seconds spent in the parking orbit This was followed by a Injection TLI burn of the third stage for seconds accelerating the spacecraft from an orbital velocity of to the injection velocity of which set a record for the highest speed relative to Earth that humans had ever traveled This speed was slightly less than the Earth escape velocity of but put Apollo into an elongated elliptical Earth orbit to a point where the Moon gravity would capture it The standard lunar orbit for Apollo missions was planned as a nominal circular orbit above the Moon surface Initial lunar orbit insertion was an ellipse with a perilune of and an apolune of at an inclination of from the lunar equator This was then circularized at by with an orbital period of minutes The effect of lunar mass concentrations masscons on the orbit was found to be greater than initially predicted over the course of the mission the orbit was perturbated to by Apollo achieved a maximum distance from Earth of Launch and injection Apollo launched at Eastern Standard Time on December using the Saturn V three stages and to achieve Earth orbit The launch phase experienced only three minor problems The engines of the first stage underperformed by causing the engines to burn for seconds longer than planned and toward the end of the second stage burn the rocket underwent pogo oscillations Frank Borman estimated the oscillations were approximately and All three rocket stages fired during launch the and detached during launch The impacted the Atlantic Ocean at and the second stage at The third stage of the rocket assisted in driving the craft into Earth orbit but remained attached to later perform the TLI burn that would put the spacecraft on a trajectory to the Moon Once in Earth orbit both the Apollo crew and Mission Control spent the next hours and minutes checking that the spacecraft was in proper working order and ready for TLI The proper operation of the third stage of the rocket was crucial in the last unmanned test the had failed to for TLI During the flight three fellow astronauts served on the ground as Capsule Communicators usually referred to as CAPCOMs on a rotating schedule The CAPCOMs were the only people who regularly communicated with the crew Michael Collins was the first CAPCOM on duty and at hours minutes and seconds after launch radioed Apollo You are Go for TLI This communication signified that Mission Control had given official permission for Apollo to go to the Moon Over the next minutes before the TLI burn the Apollo crew continued to monitor the spacecraft and the The engine ignited on time and performed the TLI burn perfectly After the had performed its required tasks it was jettisoned The crew then rotated the spacecraft to take some photographs of the spent stage and then practiced flying in formation with it As the crew rotated the spacecraft they had their first views of the Earth as they moved away from it This marked the first time humans could view the whole Earth at once Borman became worried that the was staying too close to the Module and suggested to Mission Control that the crew perform a separation maneuver Mission Control first suggested pointing the spacecraft towards Earth and using the Reaction Control System RCS thrusters on the Service Module SM to add away from the Earth but Borman did not want to lose sight of the After discussion the crew and Mission Control decided to burn in this direction but at instead These discussions put the crew an hour behind their flight plan Five hours after launch Mission Control sent a command to the booster to vent its remaining fuel through its engine bell to change the booster trajectory This would then pass the Moon and enter into a solar orbit posing no further hazard to Apollo The subsequently went into a solar orbit with an inclination of from the plane of the ecliptic and an orbital period of days After the insertion into orbit the Saturn IVB third stage became a derelict object where it would continue to orbit the Sun for many years it remains in orbit The Apollo crew were the first humans to pass through the Van Allen radiation belts which extend up to from Earth Scientists predicted that passing through the belts quickly at the spacecraft high speed would cause a radiation dosage of no more than a chest or milligray during a year the average human receives a dose of to mGy To record the actual radiation dosages each crew member wore a Personal Radiation Dosimeter that transmitted data to Earth as well as three passive film dosimeters that showed the cumulative radiation experienced by the crew By the end of the mission the crew experienced an average radiation dose of mGy Lunar trajectory Jim Lovell main job as Command Module Pilot was as navigator Although Mission Control performed all the actual navigation calculations it was necessary to have a crew member serving as navigator so that the crew could successfully return to Earth in case of communication loss with Mission Control Lovell navigated by star sightings using a sextant built into the spacecraft measuring the angle between a star and the Earth or the Moon horizon This task proved to be difficult as a large cloud of debris around the spacecraft formed by the venting made it hard to distinguish the stars By seven hours into the mission the crew was about one hour and minutes behind flight plan due to the issues of moving away from the and Lovell obscured star sightings The crew now placed the spacecraft into Passive Thermal Control PTC also known as barbecue roll PTC involved the spacecraft rotating about once per hour along its long axis to ensure even heat distribution across the surface of the spacecraft In direct sunlight the spacecraft could be heated to over while the parts in shadow would be These temperatures could cause the heat shield to crack or propellant lines to burst As it was impossible to get a perfect roll the spacecraft actually swept out a cone as it rotated The crew had to make minor adjustments every as the cone pattern got larger and larger The first correction came hours into the flight Testing on the ground had shown that the Service Propulsion System SPS engine had a small chance of exploding when burned for long periods unless its combustion chamber was coated first Burning the engine for a short period would accomplish coating This first correction burn was only seconds and added about velocity prograde in the direction of travel This change was less than the planned due to a bubble of helium in the oxidizer lines causing lower than expected fuel pressure The crew had to use the small RCS thrusters to make up the shortfall Two later planned corrections were canceled as the Apollo trajectory was found to be perfect hours into the flight the crew had been awake for over hours Before launch NASA had decided that at least one crew member should be awake at all times to deal with any issues that might arise Borman started the first sleep shift but between the constant radio chatter and mechanical noises he found sleep difficult About an hour after starting his sleep shift Borman requested clearance to take a Seconal sleeping pill However the pill had little effect Borman eventually fell asleep but then awoke feeling ill He vomited twice and had a bout of diarrhea that left the spacecraft full of small globules of vomit and feces that the crew cleaned up to the best of their ability Borman initially decided that he did not want everyone to know about his medical problems but Lovell and Anders wanted to inform Mission Control The crew decided to use the Data Storage Equipment DSE which could tape voice recordings and telemetry and dump them to Mission Control at high speed After recording a description of Borman illness they requested that Mission Control check the recording stating that they would like an evaluation of the voice comments The Apollo crew and Mission Control medical personnel held a conference using an unoccupied second floor control room there were two identical control rooms in Houston on the second and third floor only one of which was used during a mission The conference participants decided that there was little to worry about and that Borman illness was either a flu as Borman thought or a reaction to the sleeping pill Researchers now believe that he was suffering from space adaptation syndrome which affects about a third of astronauts during their first day in space as their vestibular system adapts to weightlessness Space adaptation syndrome had not been an issue on previous spacecraft Mercury and Gemini as those astronauts were unable to move freely in the comparatively smaller cabins of those spacecraft The increased cabin space in the Apollo Command Module afforded astronauts greater freedom of movement contributing to symptoms of space sickness for Borman and later astronaut Russell Schweickart during Apollo The cruise phase was a relatively uneventful part of the flight except for the crew checking that the spacecraft was in working order and that they were on course During this time NASA scheduled a television broadcast at hours after launch The Apollo crew used a kg camera that broadcast in only using a Vidicon tube The camera had two lenses a very lens and a telephoto lens During this first broadcast the crew gave a tour of the spacecraft and attempted to show how the Earth appeared from space However difficulties aiming the lens without the aid of a monitor to show what it was looking at made showing the Earth impossible Additionally the Earth image became saturated by any bright source without proper filters In the end all the crew could show the people watching back on Earth was a bright blob After broadcasting for minutes the rotation of the spacecraft took the antenna out of view of the receiving stations on Earth and they ended the transmission with Lovell wishing his mother a happy birthday By this time the crew had completely abandoned the planned sleep shifts Lovell went to sleep hours into the flight hours before he had planned to A short while later Anders also went to sleep after taking a sleeping pill The crew was unable to see the Moon for much of the outward cruise Two factors made the Moon almost impossible to see from inside the spacecraft three of the five windows fogging up due to oils from the silicone sealant and the attitude required for the PTC It was not until the crew had gone behind the Moon that they would be able to see it for the first time The Apollo made a second television broadcast at hours into the flight This time the crew rigged up filters meant for the still cameras so they could acquire images of the Earth through the telephoto lens Although difficult to aim as they had to maneuver the entire spacecraft the crew was able to broadcast back to Earth the first television pictures of the Earth The crew spent the transmission describing the Earth and what was visible and the colors they could see The transmission lasted minutes Lunar sphere of influence At about hours and minutes into the flight the crew of Apollo became the first humans to enter the gravitational sphere of influence of another celestial body In other words the effect of the Moon gravitational force on Apollo became stronger than that of the Earth At the time it happened Apollo was from the Moon and had a speed of relative to the Moon This historic moment was of little interest to the crew since they were still calculating their trajectory with respect to the launch pad at Kennedy Space Center They would continue to do so until they performed their last correction switching to a reference frame based on ideal orientation for the second engine burn they would make in lunar orbit It was only hours until they would be in lunar orbit The last major event before Lunar Orbit Insertion LOI was a second correction It was in retrograde against direction of travel and slowed the spacecraft down by effectively lowering the closest distance that the spacecraft would pass the moon At exactly hours after launch about from the Moon the crew burned the RCS for seconds They would now pass from the lunar surface At hours into the flight the crew began to prepare for Lunar Orbit This maneuver had to be performed perfectly and due to orbital mechanics had to be on the far side of the Moon out of contact with the Earth After Mission Control was polled for a go decision the crew was told at hours they were Go and riding the best bird we can find At hours and minutes the spacecraft went behind the Moon and out of radio contact with the Earth With minutes before the the crew began one last check of the spacecraft systems and made sure that every switch was in the correct place At that time they finally got their first glimpses of the Moon They had been flying over the unlit side and it was Lovell who saw the first shafts of sunlight obliquely illuminating the lunar surface The LOI burn was only two minutes away so the crew had little time to appreciate the view Lunar orbit The SPS ignited at hours minutes and seconds after launch and burned for minutes and seconds placing the Apollo spacecraft in orbit around the Moon The crew described the burn as being the longest four minutes of their lives If the burn had not lasted exactly the correct amount of time the spacecraft could have ended up in a highly elliptical lunar orbit or even flung off into space If it lasted too long they could have struck the Moon After making sure the spacecraft was working they finally had a chance to look at the Moon which they would orbit for the next hours On Earth Mission Control continued to wait If the crew had not burned the engine or the burn had not lasted the planned length of time the crew would appear early from behind the Moon However this time came and went without Apollo reappearing Exactly at the calculated moment the signal was received from the spacecraft indicating it was in a orbit about the Moon After reporting on the status of the spacecraft Lovell gave the first description of what the lunar surface looked like Lovell continued to describe the terrain they were passing over One of the crew major tasks was reconnaissance of planned future landing sites on the Moon especially one in Mare Tranquillitatis that would be the Apollo landing site The launch time of Apollo had been chosen to give the best lighting conditions for examining the site A film camera had been set up in one of the spacecraft windows to record a frame every second of the Moon below Bill Anders spent much of the next hours taking as many photographs as possible of targets of interest By the end of the mission the crew had taken photographs of the Moon and of the Earth Throughout the hour that the spacecraft was in contact with Earth Borman kept asking how the data for the SPS looked He wanted to make sure that the engine was working and could be used to return early to the Earth if necessary He also asked that they receive a go decision before they passed behind the Moon on each orbit As they reappeared for their second pass in front of the Moon the crew set up the equipment to broadcast a view of the lunar surface Anders described the craters that they were passing over At the end of this second orbit they performed the burn of the SPS to circularize the orbit to Through the next two orbits the crew continued to keep check of the spacecraft and to observe and photograph the Moon During the third pass Borman read a small prayer for his church He had been scheduled to participate in a service at Christopher Episcopal Church near Seabrook Texas but due to the Apollo flight he was unable to A fellow parishioner and engineer at Mission Control Rod Rose suggested that Borman read the prayer which could be recorded and then replayed during the service In the foreword to the Millennial Edition of his novel Arthur Clarke says the crew had told him that they had been tempted to radio back the discovery of a large black monolith but discretion prevailed Earthrise When the spacecraft came out from behind the Moon for its fourth pass across the front the crew witnessed Earthrise for the first time in human history NASA Lunar Orbiter took the very first picture of an Earthrise from the vicinity of the Moon on August Borman saw the Earth emerging from behind the lunar horizon and called in excitement to the others taking a photo as he did so In the ensuing scramble Anders took the more famous color photo later picked by Life magazine as one of its hundred photos of the century Due to the synchronous rotation of the Moon about the Earth Earthrise is not generally visible from the lunar surface Earthrise is generally only visible when orbiting the Moon other than at selected places near the Moon limb where libration carries the Earth slightly above and below the lunar horizon Anders continued to take photographs while Lovell assumed control of the spacecraft so Borman could rest Despite the difficulty resting in the cramped and noisy spacecraft Borman was able to sleep for two orbits awakening periodically to ask questions about their status Borman awoke fully however when he started to hear his fellow crew members make mistakes They were beginning to not understand questions and would have to ask for the answers to be repeated Borman realized that everyone was extremely tired having not had a good night sleep in over three days Taking command he ordered Anders and Lovell to get some sleep and that the rest of the flight plan regarding observing the Moon be scrubbed At first Anders protested saying that he was fine but Borman would not be swayed At last Anders agreed as long as Borman would set up the camera to continue to take automatic shots of the Moon Borman also remembered that there was a second television broadcast planned and with so many people expected to be watching he wanted the crew to be alert For the next two orbits Anders and Lovell slept while Borman sat at the helm On subsequent Apollo missions crews would avoid this situation by sleeping on the same schedule As they rounded the Moon for the ninth time the second television transmission began Borman introduced the crew followed by each man giving his impression of the lunar surface and what it was like to be orbiting the Moon Borman described it as being a vast lonely forbidding expanse of nothing Then after talking about what they were flying over Anders said that the crew had a message for all those on Earth Each man on board read a section from the Biblical creation story from the Book of Genesis Borman finished the broadcast by wishing a Merry Christmas to everyone on Earth His message appeared to sum up the feelings that all three crewmen had from their vantage point in lunar orbit Borman said And from the crew of Apollo we close with good night good luck a Merry Christmas and God bless all of you all of you on the good Earth The only task left for the crew at this point was to perform the Injection TEI which was scheduled for hours after the end of the television transmission The TEI was the most critical burn of the flight as any failure of the SPS to ignite would strand the crew in lunar orbit with little hope of escape As with the previous burn the crew had to perform the maneuver above the far side of the Moon out of contact with Earth The burn occurred exactly on time The spacecraft telemetry was reacquired as it from behind the Moon at hours minutes and seconds the exact time calculated When voice contact was regained Lovell announced Please be informed there is a Santa Claus to which Ken Mattingly the current CAPCOM replied That affirmative you are the best ones to know The spacecraft began its journey back to Earth on December Christmas Day Unplanned manual Later Lovell used some otherwise idle time to do some navigational sightings maneuvering the module to view various stars by using the computer keyboard However he accidentally erased some of the computer memory which caused the Inertial Measurement Unit IMU to think the module was in the same relative position it had been in before and fire the thrusters to correct the module attitude Once the crew realized why the computer had changed the module attitude they realized they would have to data that would tell the computer its real position It took Lovell ten minutes to figure out the right numbers using the thrusters to get the stars Rigel and Sirius aligned and another minutes to enter the corrected data into the computer months later Lovell would once again have to perform a similar manual under more critical conditions during the Apollo mission after that module IMU had to be turned off to conserve energy In his book Lost Moon The Perilous Voyage of Apollo Lovell wrote My training on Apollo came in handy In that book he dismissed the incident as a planned experiment requested by the ground crew In subsequent interviews Lovell has acknowledged that the incident was an accident caused by his mistake Cruise back to Earth and The cruise back to Earth was mostly a time for the crew to relax and monitor the spacecraft As long as the trajectory specialists had calculated everything correctly the spacecraft would days after TEI and splashdown in the Pacific On Christmas afternoon the crew made their fifth television broadcast This time they gave a tour of the spacecraft showing how an astronaut lived in space When they finished broadcasting they found a small present from Deke Slayton in the food locker a real turkey dinner with stuffing in the same kind of pack that the troops in Vietnam received Another Slayton surprise was a gift of three miniature bottles of brandy that Borman ordered the crew to leave alone until after they landed They remained unopened even years after the flight There were also small presents to the crew from their wives The next day at about hours into the mission the sixth and final TV transmission showed the mission best video images of the earth in a broadcast After two uneventful days the crew prepared for The computer would control the and all the crew had to do was put the spacecraft in the correct attitude blunt end forward If the computer broke down Borman would take over Once the Command Module was separated from the Service Module the astronauts were committed to Six minutes before they hit the top of the atmosphere the crew saw the Moon rising above the Earth horizon just as had been predicted by the trajectory specialists As they hit the thin outer atmosphere they noticed it was becoming hazy outside as glowing plasma formed around the spacecraft The spacecraft started slowing down and the deceleration peaked at g With the computer controlling the descent by changing the attitude of the spacecraft Apollo rose briefly like a skipping stone before descending to the ocean At the drogue parachute stabilized the spacecraft and was followed at by the three main parachutes The spacecraft splashdown position was officially reported as in the North Pacific Ocean south of Hawaii When it hit the water the parachutes dragged the spacecraft over and left it upside down in what was termed Stable position About six minutes later the Command Module was righted into its normal splashdown orientation by the inflatable bag uprighting system As they were buffeted by a swell Borman was sick waiting for the three flotation balloons to right the spacecraft It was minutes after splashdown before the first frogman from the USS Yorktown arrived as the spacecraft had landed before sunrise minutes later the crew was safe on the deck of the aircraft carrier Historical importance Apollo came at the end of a year that had seen much upheaval in the United States and most of the world Even though the year saw political assassinations political unrest in the streets of Europe and America and the Prague Spring Time magazine chose the crew of Apollo as their Men of the Year for recognizing them as the people who most influenced events in the preceding year They had been the first people ever to leave the gravitational influence of the Earth and orbit another celestial body They had survived a mission that even the crew themselves had rated as only having a chance of fully succeeding The effect of Apollo can be summed up by a telegram from a stranger received by Borman after the mission that simply stated Thank you Apollo You saved One of the most famous aspects of the flight was the Earthrise picture that was taken as they came around for their fourth orbit of the Moon This was the first time that humans had taken such a picture whilst actually behind the camera and it has been credited with a role in inspiring the first Earth Day in It was selected as the first of Life magazine Photographs That Changed the World Apollo astronaut Michael Collins said Eight momentous historic significance was foremost while many space historians such as Robert Poole see Apollo as the most historically significant of all the Apollo missions The mission was the most widely covered by the media since the first American orbital flight by John Glenn in There were journalists covering the mission with the BBC coverage being broadcast in countries in different languages The Soviet newspaper Pravda featured a quote from Boris Nikolaevich Petrov Chairman of the Soviet Interkosmos program who described the flight as an outstanding achievement of American space sciences and technology It is estimated that a quarter of the people alive at the time saw either live or delayed the Christmas Eve transmission during the ninth orbit of the Moon The Apollo broadcasts won an Emmy Award the highest honor given by the Academy of Television Arts Sciences Madalyn Murray an atheist later caused controversy by bringing a lawsuit against NASA over the reading from Genesis wished the courts to ban American astronauts who were all government employees from public prayer in space Though the case was rejected by the Supreme Court of the United States for lack of jurisdiction it caused NASA to be skittish about the issue of religion throughout the rest of the Apollo program Buzz Aldrin on Apollo Presbyterian Communion on the surface of the Moon after landing he refrained from mentioning this publicly for several years and only obliquely referred to it at the time In the United States Postal Service issued a postage stamp Scott catalogue commemorating the Apollo flight around the Moon The stamp featured a detail of the famous photograph of the Earthrise over the Moon taken by Anders on Christmas Eve and the words In the beginning God Just days after the crew return to Earth they were featured during the Super Bowl show reciting the Pledge of Allegiance prior to the national anthem being performed by Anita Bryant Spacecraft location In January the spacecraft was delivered to Osaka Japan for display in the pavilion at Expo It is now displayed at the Chicago Museum of Science and Industry along with a collection of personal items from the flight donated by Lovell and the space suit worn by Frank Borman Jim Lovell Apollo space suit is on public display in the Visitor Center at NASA Glenn Research Center Bill Anders space suit is on display at the Science Museum in London United Kingdom In film Apollo historic mission has been shown and referred to in several forms both documentary and fiction The various television transmissions and mm footage shot by the crew of Apollo was compiled and released by NASA in the documentary Debrief Apollo which was hosted by Burgess Meredith In addition Spacecraft Films released in a DVD set containing all of NASA TV and mm film footage related to the mission including all TV transmissions from space training and launch footage and motion pictures taken in flight Portions of the Apollo Mission can be seen in the documentary For All Mankind which won the Grand Jury Prize Documentary at the Sundance Film Festival The Apollo mission was in the British documentary In the Shadow of the Moon Portions of the Apollo mission are dramatized in the miniseries From the Earth to the Moon episode The stage of Apollo was also portrayed as the location of an alien device in the UFO episode Conflict At the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex V Center the history of the space program leading up to the launch of Apollo is the subject of a multimedia presentation which also features the actual control panels used in the Firing Room for the launch
