Academy Awards The Academy Awards or The Oscars the official title was rebranded as The Oscars in changed from The Academy Awards is an annual American awards ceremony honoring cinematic achievements in the film industry The various category winners are awarded a copy of a statuette officially the Academy Award of Merit that is better known by its nickname Oscar The awards first presented in at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel are overseen by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences AMPAS The awards ceremony was first televised in and is now seen live in more than countries The Oscars is also the oldest entertainment awards ceremony its equivalents the Emmy Awards for television the Tony Awards for theatre and the Grammy Awards for music and recording are modeled after the Academy Awards The Academy Awards ceremony was held on March at the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles later than usual as to not clash with the Winter Olympics in Sochi Russia The Academy Awards is scheduled for February History The first Academy Awards presentation was held on May at a private dinner at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel with an audience of about people The party was held at the Mayfair Hotel The cost of guest tickets for that night ceremony was as of Fifteen statuettes were awarded honoring artists directors and other personalities of the industry of the time for their works during the period the ceremony ran for minutes Winners had been announced to media three months earlier however that was changed in the second ceremony of the Academy Awards in Since then and during the first decade the results were given to newspapers for publication at pm on the night of the awards This method was used until the Los Angeles Times announced the winners before the ceremony began as a result the Academy has since used a sealed envelope to reveal the name of the winners The first Best Actor awarded was Emil Jannings for his performances in The Last Command and The Way of All Flesh He had to return to Europe before the ceremony so the Academy agreed to give him the prize earlier this made him the first Academy Award winner in history The honored professionals were awarded for all the work done in a certain category for the qualifying period for example Jannings received the award for two movies in which he starred during that period and Janet Gaynor later won a single Oscar for performances in three films Since the fourth ceremony the system changed and professionals were honored for a specific performance in a single film For the first six ceremonies the eligibility period spanned two calendar years At the ceremony held on March the Best Foreign Language Film category was introduced Until then films were honored with the Special Achievement Award a total of Oscars have been awarded Oscar statuette Although there are seven other types of annual awards presented by the Academy the Irving Thalberg Memorial Award the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award the Gordon Sawyer Award the Academy Scientific and Technical Award the Academy Award for Technical Achievement the John Bonner Medal of Commendation and the Student Academy Award plus two awards that are not presented annually the Special Achievement Award in the form of an Oscar statuette and the Honorary Award that may or may not be in the form of an Oscar statuette the best known one is the Academy Award of Merit more popularly known as the Oscar statuette Made of britannium on a black metal base it is in cm tall weighs lb kg and depicts a knight rendered in Art Deco style holding a crusader sword standing on a reel of film with five spokes The five spokes represent the original branches of the Academy Actors Writers Directors Producers and Technicians In MGM art director Cedric Gibbons one of the original Academy members supervised the design of the award trophy by printing the design on a scroll In need of a model for his statuette Gibbons was introduced by his future wife Dolores del R o to Mexican film director and actor Emilio El Indio Fern ndez Reluctant at first Fern ndez was finally convinced to pose nude to create what today is known as the Oscar Then sculptor George Stanley who also did the Muse Fountain at the Hollywood Bowl sculpted Gibbons design in clay and Sachin Smith cast the statuette in percent tin and percent copper and then it The only addition to the Oscar since it was created is a minor streamlining of the base The original Oscar mold was cast in at the Shumway Sons Foundry in Batavia Illinois which also contributed to casting the molds for the Vince Lombardi Trophy and Emmy Awards statuettes Since approximately Oscars are made each year in Chicago by Illinois manufacturer Owens Company The awards weigh each and take between three to four weeks to manufacture each statue In support of the American effort in World War II the statuettes were made of plaster and were traded in for gold ones after the war had ended Naming The origin of the name Oscar is disputed One biography of Bette Davis claims that she named the Oscar after her first husband band leader Harmon Oscar Nelson one of the earliest mentions in print of the term Oscar dates back to a Time magazine article about the Academy Awards Walt Disney is also quoted as thanking the Academy for his Oscar as early as Another claimed origin is that the Academy Executive Secretary Margaret Herrick first saw the award in and made reference to the statuette reminding her of her Uncle Oscar a nickname for her cousin Oscar Pierce Columnist Sidney Skolsky was present during Herrick naming and seized the name in his byline Employees have affectionately dubbed their famous statuette Oscar The trophy was officially dubbed the Oscar in by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences Ownership of Oscar statuettes Since the statuettes have been legally encumbered by the requirement that neither winners nor their heirs may sell the statuettes without first offering to sell them back to the Academy for If a winner refuses to agree to this stipulation then the Academy keeps the statuette Academy Awards not protected by this agreement have been sold in public auctions and private deals for sums In December Orson Welles Oscar for Citizen Kane Best Original Screenplay was put up for auction after his heirs won a court decision contending that Welles did not sign any agreement to return the statue to the Academy On December it sold in an online auction for In Harold Russell needed money for his wife medical expenses In a controversial decision he consigned his Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for The Best Years of Our Lives to Herman Darvick Autograph Auctions and on August in New York City the Oscar sold to a private collector for Russell defended his action saying I do know why anybody would be critical My wife health is much more important than sentimental reasons The movie will be here even if Oscar is Harold Russell is the only Academy Award winning actor to ever sell an Oscar While the Oscar is owned by the recipient it is essentially not on the open market Michael Todd grandson tried to sell Todd Oscar statuette to a movie prop collector in but the Academy won the legal battle by getting a permanent injunction Although some Oscar sales transactions have been successful some buyers have subsequently returned the statuettes to the Academy which keeps them in its treasury Nomination Since Academy Award nomination results have been announced to the public in late January Prior to that the results were announced in early February Voters The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences AMPAS a professional honorary organization maintains a voting membership of Academy membership is divided into different branches with each representing a different discipline in film production Actors constitute the largest voting bloc numbering members percent of the Academy composition Votes have been certified by the auditing firm PricewaterhouseCoopers and its predecessor Price Waterhouse for the past annual awards ceremonies All AMPAS members must be invited to join by the Board of Governors on behalf of Academy Branch Executive Committees Membership eligibility may be achieved by a competitive nomination or a member may submit a name based on other significant contribution to the field of motion pictures New membership proposals are considered annually The Academy does not publicly disclose its membership although as recently as press releases have announced the names of those who have been invited to join The release also stated that it has just under voting members While the membership had been growing stricter policies have kept its size steady since then In the results of a study conducted by The Los Angeles Times was published which revealed the demographic breakdown of approximately of AMPAS voting membership Of the active voters confirmed were Caucasian were male and were found to be over the age of of voting members are former nominees and winners In May the Academy sent a letter advising its or so voting members that an online system for Oscar voting will be implemented in Rules According to Rules and of the official Academy Awards Rules a film must open in the previous calendar year from midnight at the start of January to midnight at the end of December in Los Angeles County California to qualify except for the Best Foreign Language Film For example the Best Picture winner The Hurt Locker was actually first released in but did not qualify for the awards as it did not play its run in Los Angeles until thus qualifying for the awards Rule states that a film must be defined as a minimum of minutes except for short subject awards and it must exist either on a mm or mm film print or in or progressive scan digital cinema format with native resolution not less than Producers must submit an Official Screen Credits online form before the deadline in case it is not submitted by the defined deadline the film will be ineligible for Academy Awards in any year The form includes the production credits for all related categories Then each form is checked and put in a Reminder List of Eligible Releases In late December ballots and copies of the Reminder List of Eligible Releases are mailed to around active members For most categories members from each of the branches vote to determine the nominees only in their respective categories only directors vote for directors writers for writers actors for actors In all major categories voters use an instant runoff voting ballot with potential nominees rewarded in the single transferable vote tally for having strong supporters who rank them first There are some exceptions in the case of certain categories like Foreign Film Documentary and Animated Feature Film in which movies are selected by special screening committees made up of members from all branches In the special case of Best Picture all voting members are eligible to select the nominees for that category Foreign films must include English subtitles and each country can submit only one film per year The winners are then determined by a second round of voting in which all members are then allowed to vote in most categories including Best Picture Film companies will spend as much as several million dollars on marketing to awards voters for a movie in the running for Best Picture in attempts to improve chances of receiving Oscars and other movie awards conferred in Oscar season The Academy enforces rules to limit overt campaigning by its members so as to try to eliminate excesses and prevent the process from becoming undignified It has an awards czar on staff who advises members on allowed practices and levies penalties on offenders For example a producer of the Best Picture nominee The Hurt Locker was disqualified as a producer in the category when he contacted associates urging them to vote for his film and not another that was seen as The Hurt Locker eventually won Ceremony Telecast The major awards are presented at a live televised ceremony most commonly in late February or early March following the relevant calendar year and six weeks after the announcement of the nominees It is the culmination of the film awards season which usually begins during November or December of the previous year This is an elaborate extravaganza with the invited guests walking up the red carpet in the creations of the most prominent fashion designers of the day Black tie dress is the most common outfit for men although fashion may dictate not wearing a and musical performers sometimes do not adhere to this The artists who recorded the nominees for Best Original Song quite often perform those songs live at the awards ceremony and the fact that they are performing is often used to promote the television broadcast The Academy Awards is the only awards show that is televised live in all United States time zones excluding Hawaii they aired live in Alaska starting in for the first time since Canada the United Kingdom and gathers millions of viewers elsewhere throughout the world The ceremony was watched by more than million Americans Other awards ceremonies such as the Emmys Golden Globes and Grammys are broadcast live in the Eastern Central time zones but are on tape delay on the West Coast and might not air the same day outside North America if the awards are even televised The Academy has for several years claimed that the award show has up to a billion viewers internationally but this has so far not been confirmed by any independent sources The Awards show was first televised in on NBC which continued to broadcast the event until when the ABC Network took over televising the festivities through after which NBC resumed the broadcasts ABC once again took over broadcast duties in and it is under contract to do so through the year The first countries to broadcast the Academy Awards on television aside from the United States were Canada the United Kingdom and Mexico the latter two countries did not broadcast the live show and Mexico did not carry the live event until By seven other countries namely Brazil Cuba Venezuela West Germany Belgium the Netherlands and France were already broadcasting the Awards show although previously filmed into a condensed version called the International Edition of the Academy Awards The Awards show was broadcast for the first time via satellite in but only two South American countries Chile and Brazil purchased the rights to air the live event By that time the television rights to the Awards show were sold in countries A decade later the TV rights to the Oscars were already being sold to countries and by the TV rights to the Awards were licensed in countries Until the arrival of subscription television in Europe Africa and the Middle East which enabled the Oscars to be broadcast live through these territories there was already available a previously filmed or taped version of the Awards show which was aired on broadcast television in these territories However several Asian and Australasian countries such as Japan Hong Kong South Korea Singapore Malaysia Australia and New Zealand were already carrying the live broadcast of the Awards show since the late AMPAS still produces a condensed version of the Academy Awards for those territories in which the rights to the live broadcast are expensive After more than years of being held in late March or early April the ceremonies were moved up to late February or early March starting in to help disrupt and shorten the intense lobbying and ad campaigns associated with Oscar season in the film industry Another reason was because of the growing TV ratings success of the NCAA Men Division I Basketball Championship which would cut into the Academy Awards audience The earlier date is also to the advantage of ABC as it now usually occurs during the highly profitable and important February sweeps period Some years the ceremony is moved into early March in deference to the Winter Olympics Another reason for the move to late February and early March is to avoid the awards ceremony occurring so close to the religious holidays of Passover and Easter which for decades had been a grievance from members and the general public Advertising is somewhat restricted however as traditionally no movie studios or competitors of official Academy Award sponsors may advertise during the telecast The Awards show holds the distinction of having won the most Emmys in history with wins and nominations After many years of being held on Mondays at pm Pacific in the ceremonies were moved to Sundays at pm pm Pacific The reasons given for the move were that more viewers would tune in on Sundays that Los Angeles traffic jams could be avoided and that an earlier start time would allow viewers on the East Coast to go to bed earlier For many years the film industry had opposed a Sunday broadcast because it would cut into the weekend box office Originally scheduled for April the Academy Awards ceremony was postponed for two days because of the assassination of Martin Luther King On March the Academy Awards was postponed for one day after the shooting of President Ronald Reagan and others in Washington In an In Memoriam segment was introduced honoring those who had made a significant contribution to cinema who had died in the preceding months a selection compiled by a small committee of Academy members This segment has drawn criticism over the years for the omission of some names In terms of broadcast length the ceremony generally averages three and a half hours The first Oscars in lasted minutes At the other end of the spectrum the ceremony lasted four hours and four minutes In the organizers of the Academy Awards announced that winners acceptance speeches must not run past seconds This according to organizer Bill Mechanic was to ensure the elimination of what he termed the single most hated thing on the show overly long and embarrassing displays of emotion The Academy has contemplated moving the ceremony even further back into January citing TV viewers fatigue with the film industry long awards season However such an accelerated schedule would dramatically decrease the voting period for its members to the point where some voters would only have time to view the contending films streamed on their computers as opposed to traditionally receiving the films and ballots in the mail Also a January ceremony would have to compete with National Football League playoff games Awards ceremonies Historically the Oscarcast has pulled in a bigger haul when hits are favored to win the Best Picture trophy More than million viewers tuned to the telecast for the Academy Awards in the year of Titanic which generated close to million at the North American box office The Academy Awards ceremony in which box office earnings of million received Awards including Best Picture drew million viewers The most watched ceremony based on Nielsen ratings to date however was the Academy Awards Best Picture Midnight Cowboy which drew a household rating on April By contrast ceremonies honoring films that have not performed well at the box office tend to show weaker ratings The Academy Awards which awarded independent film Crash with a gross of million generated an audience of million with a household rating of In the Academy Awards telecast was watched by million viewers on average with an household rating the lowest rated and least watched ceremony to date in spite of celebrating years of the Academy Awards The Best Picture winner of that particular ceremony was another independently financed film No Country for Old Men Venues In the first Academy Awards were presented at a banquet dinner at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel From to the ceremony alternated between two venues the Ambassador Hotel on Wilshire Boulevard and the Biltmore Hotel in downtown Los Angeles Grauman Chinese Theater in Hollywood then hosted the awards from to followed by the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles from to The Academy Awards in were held at the Academy Award Theater at what was the Academy headquarters on Melrose Avenue in Hollywood From to the awards were presented at Hollywood Pantages Theatre With the advent of television the awards from to took place simultaneously in Hollywood and New York first at the NBC International Theatre and then at the NBC Century Theatre after which the ceremony took place solely in Los Angeles The Oscars moved to the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium in Santa Monica California in By the Academy decided to move the ceremonies back to Los Angeles this time to the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion at the Los Angeles County Music Center In the Kodak Theatre became the permanent home of the award ceremonies However due to Eastman Kodak bankruptcy issues this theatre was renamed the Hollywood and Highland Center in the days preceding the February awards ceremony As of May the theatre was once again renamed to the Dolby Theatre after Dolby Laboratories acquired the naming rights Merit categories Current categories In the first year of the awards the Best Director award was split into two separate categories Drama and Comedy At times the Best Original Score award has also been split into separate categories Drama and From the through the the Art Direction now Production Design Cinematography and Costume Design awards were likewise split into two separate categories films and color films Prior to the Production Design award was called Art Direction while the Makeup and Hairstyling award was called Makeup Another award entitled the Academy Award for Best Original Musical is still in the Academy rulebooks and has yet to be discontinued However due to continuous insufficient eligibility each year it has not been awarded since when Purple Rain won Proposed categories The Board of Governors meets each year and considers new award categories To date the following proposed categories have been rejected Special categories The Special Academy Awards are voted on by special committees rather than by the Academy membership as a whole They are not always presented on a consistent annual basis Critical reception and review Due to the positive exposure and prestige of the Academy Awards studios spend millions of dollars and hire publicists specifically to promote their films during what is typically called the Oscar season This has generated accusations of the Academy Awards being influenced more by marketing than quality William Friedkin an Academy film director and former producer of the ceremony expressed this sentiment at a conference in New York in describing it as the greatest promotion scheme that any industry ever devised for itself In addition some winners critical of the Academy Awards have boycotted the ceremonies and refused to accept their Oscars The first to do so was Dudley Nichols Best Writing in for The Informer Nichols boycotted the Academy Awards ceremony because of conflicts between the Academy and the Writers Guild George Scott became the second person to refuse his award Best Actor in for Patton at the Academy Awards ceremony Scott described it as a meat parade saying I do want any part of it The third was Marlon Brando who refused his award Best Actor in for The Godfather citing the film industry discrimination and mistreatment of Native Americans At the Academy Awards ceremony Brando sent Sacheen Littlefeather to read a speech detailing his criticisms Tim Dirks editor of AMC has written of the Academy Awards Typical criticism of the Academy Awards for Best Picture is that among the winners and nominees there is an of romantic historical epics biographical dramas romantic dramedies and family melodramas most of which are released in the the last three months of the calendar year This has led to the coining of the term Oscar bait describing such movies Overall the Academy appears to go through periods of rewarding a certain type of film movies in the early social issue dramas in the late late and musicals and historical epics in the family melodramas and biographical epics in the late and throughout the atypical genres movies formerly considered B movies in the early and romantic historical epic dramas in the late and early independent violent movies from critically acclaimed directors in the late and century historical movies in the This has led at times to more specific criticisms that the Academy is disconnected from the audience by favoring Oscar bait over audience favorites or favoring historical melodramas over critically acclaimed movies that depict current life issues Acting prizes in certain years have been criticized for not recognizing superior performances so much as being awarded for sentimental reasons personal popularity atonement for past mistakes or presented as a career honor to recognize a distinguished nominee entire body of work Associated events The following events are closely associated with the annual Academy Awards ceremony Presenter and performer gifts It has become a tradition to give out gift bags to the presenters and performers at the Oscars In recent years these gifts have also been extended to award nominees and winners The total value of these gifts can reach into the of thousands of dollars In the value was reported to be as high as The value has risen to the point where the Internal Revenue Service issued a statement regarding the gifts and their taxable status Oscar gift bags have included vacation packages to Hawaii and Mexico and Japan a private dinner party for the recipient and
