ASCII ASCII abbreviated from American Standard Code for Information Interchange is a scheme Originally based on the English alphabet it encodes specified characters into binary integers as shown by the ASCII chart on the right The characters encoded are numbers to lowercase letters a to z uppercase letters A to Z basic punctuation symbols control codes that originated with Teletype machines and a space For example lowercase j would become binary and decimal ASCII codes represent text in computers communications equipment and other devices that use text Most modern schemes are based on ASCII though they support many additional characters ASCII developed from telegraphic codes Its first commercial use was as a teleprinter code promoted by Bell data services Work on the ASCII standard began on October with the first meeting of the American Standards Association ASA subcommittee The first edition of the standard was published during a major revision during and the most recent update during Compared to earlier telegraph codes the proposed Bell code and ASCII were both ordered for more convenient sorting alphabetization of lists and added features for devices other than teleprinters ASCII includes definitions for characters are control characters many now obsolete that affect how text and space are processed and printable characters including the space which is considered an invisible graphic The IANA prefers the name ASCII was the most common character encoding on the World Wide Web until December when it was surpassed by which includes ASCII as a subset History The American Standard Code for Information Interchange ASCII was developed under the auspices of a committee of the American Standards Association called the committee by its later subcommittee and later by that subcommittee working group The ASA became the United States of America Standards Institute or USASI and ultimately the American National Standards Institute Bit width The subcommittee designed ASCII based on the earlier teleprinter encoding systems Like other character encodings ASCII specifies a correspondence between digital bit patterns and character symbols graphemes and control characters This allows digital devices to communicate with each other and to process store and communicate information such as written language Before ASCII was developed the encodings in use included alphabetic characters numerical digits and from to special graphic symbols To include all these and control characters compatible with the Comit Consultatif International T l phonique et T l graphique CCITT International Telegraph Alphabet standard Fieldata and early EBCDIC more than codes were required for ASCII The committee debated the possibility of a shift function like in which would allow more than codes to be represented by a code In a shifted code some character codes determine choices between options for the following character codes It allows compact encoding but is less reliable for data transmission an error in transmitting the shift code typically makes a long part of the transmission unreadable The standards committee decided against shifting and so ASCII required at least a code The committee considered an code since eight bits octets would allow two patterns to efficiently encode two digits with decimal However it would require all data transmission to send eight bits when seven could suffice The committee voted to use a code to minimize costs associated with data transmission Since perforated tape at the time could record eight bits in one position it also allowed for a parity bit for error checking if desired machines with octets as the native data type that did not use parity checking typically set the eighth bit to Organization The code itself was patterned so that most control codes were together and all graphic codes were together for ease of identification The first two columns positions were reserved for control characters The space character had to come before graphics to make sorting easier so it became position for the same reason many special signs commonly used as separators were placed before digits The committee decided it was important to support upper case alphabets and chose to pattern ASCII so it could be reduced easily to a usable set of graphic codes as was done in the DEC SIXBIT code Lower case letters were therefore not interleaved with upper case To keep options available for lower case letters and other graphics the special and numeric codes were arranged before the letters and the letter A was placed in position to match the draft of the corresponding British standard The digits were arranged so they correspond to values in binary prefixed with making conversion with decimal straightforward Many of the characters were positioned to correspond to their shifted position on typewriters an important subtlety is that these were based on mechanical typewriters not electric typewriters Mechanical typewriters followed the standard set by the Remington the first typewriter with a shift key and the shifted values of were early typewriters omitted and using O capital letter o and l lowercase letter L instead but and pairs became standard once and became common Thus in ASCII were placed in second column rows corresponding to the digits in the adjacent column The parentheses could not correspond to and however because the place corresponding to was taken by the space character This was accommodated by removing underscore from and shifting the remaining characters left this corresponded to many European typewriters which placed the parentheses with and This discrepancy from typewriters led to keyboards notably the Teletype Model which used the layout corresponding to ASCII not to traditional mechanical typewriters Electric typewriters notably the more recently introduced IBM Selectric used a somewhat different layout that has become standard on computersfollowing the IBM PC especially Model M and thus shift values for symbols on modern keyboards do not correspond as closely to the ASCII table as earlier keyboards did The pair also dates to the and the pairs were used on some keyboards others including the did not shift comma or full stop so they could be used in uppercase without unshifting However ASCII split the pair dating to and rearranged mathematical symbols varied conventions commonly to Some common characters were not included notably while were included as diacritics for international use and for mathematical use together with the simple line characters in addition to common The symbol was not used in continental Europe and the committee expected it would be replaced by an accented in the French variation so the was placed in position right before the letter A The control codes felt essential for data transmission were the start of message SOM end of address EOA end of message EOM end of transmission EOT who are you WRU are you RU a reserved device control synchronous idle SYNC and acknowledge ACK These were positioned to maximize the Hamming distance between their bit patterns Publication With the other special characters and control codes filled in ASCII was published as ASA leaving code positions without any assigned meaning reserved for future standardization and one unassigned control code There was some debate at the time whether there should be more control characters rather than the lower case alphabet The indecision did not last long during May the CCITT Working Party on the New Telegraph Alphabet proposed to assign lower case characters to columns and and International Organization for Standardization TC SC voted during October to incorporate the change into its draft standard The task group voted its approval for the change to ASCII at its May meeting Locating the lowercase letters in columns and caused the characters to differ in bit pattern from the upper case by a single bit which simplified character matching and the construction of keyboards and printers The committee made other changes including other new characters the brace and vertical bar characters renaming some control characters SOM became start of header SOH and moving or removing others RU was removed ASCII was subsequently updated as USASI then USASI ANSI and finally ANSI the first two are occasionally retronamed ANSI and ANSI The committee also addressed how ASCII should be transmitted least significant bit first and how it should be recorded on perforated tape They proposed a standard for magnetic tape and attempted to deal with some forms of punched card formats Use ASCII itself was first used commercially during as a teleprinter code for American Telephone Telegraph TWX TeletypeWriter eXchange network TWX originally used the earlier which was also used by the competing Telex teleprinter system Bob Bemer introduced features such as the escape sequence His British colleague Hugh McGregor Ross helped to popularize this work according to Bemer so much so that the code that was to become ASCII was first called the Code in Europe Because of his extensive work on ASCII Bemer has been called the father of ASCII On March President Lyndon Johnson mandated that all computers purchased by the United States federal government support ASCII stating I have also approved recommendations of the Secretary of Commerce regarding standards for recording the Standard Code for Information Interchange on magnetic tapes and paper tapes when they are used in computer operations All computers and related equipment configurations brought into the Federal Government inventory on and after July must have the capability to use the Standard Code for Information Interchange and the formats prescribed by the magnetic tape and paper tape standards when these media are used Other standards Other international standards bodies have ratified character encodings such as that are identical or nearly identical to ASCII with extensions for characters outside the English alphabet and symbols used outside the United States such as the symbol for the United Kingdom pound sterling Almost every country needed an adapted version of ASCII since ASCII suited the needs of only the USA and a few other countries For example Canada had its own version that supported French characters Other adapted encodings include ISCII India VISCII Vietnam and YUSCII Yugoslavia Although these encodings are sometimes referred to as ASCII true ASCII is defined strictly only by the ANSI standard ASCII was incorporated into the Unicode character set as the first symbols so the ASCII characters have the same numeric codes in both sets This allows to be backward compatible with ASCII as a file containing only ASCII characters is identical to an ASCII file containing the same sequence of characters Even more importantly forward compatibility is ensured as software that recognizes only ASCII characters as special and does not alter bytes with the highest bit set as is often done to support ASCII extensions such as will preserve data unchanged ASCII control characters ASCII reserves the first codes numbers decimal for control characters codes originally intended not to represent printable information but rather to control devices such as printers that make use of ASCII or to provide about data streams such as those stored on magnetic tape For example character represents the line feed function which causes a printer to advance its paper and character represents backspace RFC refers to control characters that do not include carriage return line feed or white space as control characters Except for the control characters that prescribe elementary formatting ASCII does not define any mechanism for describing the structure or appearance of text within a document Other schemes such as markup languages address page and document layout and formatting The original ASCII standard used only short descriptive phrases for each control character The ambiguity this caused was sometimes intentional for example where a character would be used slightly differently on a terminal link than on a data stream and sometimes accidental for example with the meaning of delete Probably the most influential single device on the interpretation of these characters was the Teletype Model ASR which was a printing terminal with an available paper tape option Paper tape was a very popular medium for program storage until the less costly and in some ways less fragile than magnetic tape In particular the Teletype Model machine assignments for codes also known as XON also known as XOFF and Delete became de facto standards The Model was also notable for taking the description of BEL meaning audibly alert the operator literally the unit contained an actual bell which it rang when it received a BEL character Because the keytop for the O key also showed a symbol from which had this character instead of underscore a noncompliant use of code Shift In interpreted as delete previous character was also adopted by many early timesharing systems but eventually became neglected When a Teletype ASR equipped with the automatic paper tape reader received a XOFF an abbreviation for transmit off it caused the tape reader to stop receiving XON transmit on caused the tape reader to resume This technique became adopted by several early computer operating systems as a handshaking signal warning a sender to stop transmission because of impending overflow it persists to this day in many systems as a manual output control technique On some systems retains its meaning but is replaced by a second to resume output The ASR also could be configured to employ and to start and stop the tape punch on some units equipped with this function the corresponding control character lettering on the keycap above the letter was TAPE and TAPE respectively Code is officially named delete but the Teletype label was rubout Since the original standard did not give detailed interpretation for most control codes interpretations of this code varied The original Teletype meaning and the intent of the standard was to make it an ignored character the same as NUL all zeroes This was useful specifically for paper tape because punching the bit pattern on top of an existing mark would obliterate it Tapes designed to be hand edited could even be produced with spaces of extra NULs blank tape so that a block of characters could be rubbed out and then replacements put into the empty space Some software assigned special meanings to ASCII characters sent to the software from the terminal Operating systems from Digital Equipment Corporation for example interpreted DEL as an input character as meaning remove input character and this interpretation also became common in Unix systems Most other systems used BS for that meaning and used DEL to mean remove the character at the cursor That latter interpretation is the most common now Many more of the control codes have been given meanings quite different from their original ones The escape character ESC code for example was intended originally to allow sending other control characters as literals instead of invoking their meaning This is the same meaning of escape encountered in URL encodings C language strings and other systems where certain characters have a reserved meaning Over time this meaning has been and has eventually been changed In modern use an ESC sent to the terminal usually indicates the start of a command sequence usually in the form of a ANSI escape code or more properly a Control Sequence Introducer beginning with ESC followed by a character An ESC sent from the terminal is most often used as an character used to terminate an operation as in the TECO and vi text editors In graphical user interface GUI and windowing systems ESC generally causes an application to abort its current operation or to exit terminate altogether The inherent ambiguity of many control characters combined with their historical usage created problems when transferring plain text files between systems The best example of this is the newline problem on various operating systems Teletype machines required that a line of text be terminated with both Carriage Return which moves the printhead to the beginning of the line and Line Feed which advances the paper one line without moving the printhead The name Carriage Return comes from the fact that on a manual typewriter the carriage holding the paper moved while the position where the typebars struck the ribbon remained stationary The entire carriage had to be pushed returned to the right in order to position the left margin of the paper for the next line DEC operating systems RSTS used both characters to mark the end of a line so that the console device originally Teletype machines would work By the time glass TTYs later called CRTs or terminals came along the convention was so well established that backward compatibility necessitated continuing the convention When Gary Kildall cloned to create he followed established DEC convention Until the introduction of PC DOS in IBM had no hand in this because their operating systems used EBCDIC instead of ASCII and they were oriented toward input and line printer output on which the concept of carriage return was meaningless IBM PC DOS also marketed as by Microsoft inherited the convention by virtue of being a clone of and Windows inherited it from Unfortunately requiring two characters to mark the end of a line introduces unnecessary complexity and questions as to how to interpret each character when encountered alone To simplify matters plain text data streams including files on Multics used line feed LF alone as a line terminator Unix and systems and Amiga systems adopted this convention from Multics The original Macintosh OS Apple DOS and ProDOS on the other hand used carriage return CR alone as a line terminator however since Apple replaced it with the OS X operating system they now use line feed LF as well Computers attached to the ARPANET included machines running operating systems such as and TENEX using line endings machines running operating systems such as Multics using LF line endings and machines running operating systems such as that represented lines as a character count followed by the characters of the line and that used EBCDIC rather than ASCII The Telnet protocol defined an ASCII Network Virtual Terminal NVT so that connections between hosts with different conventions and character sets could be supported by transmitting a standard text format over the network it used ASCII along with line endings and software using other conventions would translate between the local conventions and the NVT The File Transfer Protocol adopted the Telnet protocol including use of the Network Virtual Terminal for use when transmitting commands and transferring data in the default ASCII mode This adds complexity to implementations of those protocols and to other network protocols such as those used for and the World Wide Web on systems not using the NVT convention Older operating systems such as along with tracked file length only in units of disk blocks and used SUB to mark the end of the actual text in the file For this reason EOF or was used colloquially and conventionally as a acronym TLA for instead of SUBstitute For a variety of reasons the code ETX aka was inappropriate and using Z as the control code to end a file is analogous to it ending the alphabet a very convenient mnemonic aid An historic common and still prevalent convention uses the ETX aka code convention to interrupt and halt a program via an input data stream usually from a keyboard In C library and Unix conventions the null character is used to terminate text strings such strings can be known in abbreviation as ASCIZ or ASCIIZ where here Z stands for zero ASCII control code chart Other representations might be used by specialist equipment for example ISO graphics or hexadecimal numbers ASCII printable characters Codes to known as the printable characters represent letters digits punctuation marks and a few miscellaneous symbols There are printable characters in total Code the space character denotes the space between words as produced by the space bar of a keyboard Since the space character is considered an invisible graphic rather than a control character it is listed in the table below instead of in the previous section Code corresponds to the delete DEL control character and is therefore omitted from this chart it is covered in the previous section chart Earlier versions of ASCII used the up arrow instead of the caret and the left arrow instead of the underscore Aliases A June RFC and the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority registry of character sets recognize the following aliases for ASCII as suitable for use on the Internet Of these the IANA encourages use of the name for Internet uses of ASCII even if it is a redundant acronym but the US is needed because of abuse of the ASCII term One often finds this in the optional charset parameter in the header of some MIME messages in the equivalent meta element of some HTML documents and in the encoding declaration part of the prologue of some XML documents Variants As computer technology spread throughout the world different standards bodies and corporations developed many variations of ASCII to facilitate the expression of languages that used alphabets One could class some of these variations as ASCII extensions although some misuse that term to represent all variants including those that do not preserve ASCII in the range Furthermore the ASCII extensions have also been mislabelled as ASCII Many other countries developed variants of ASCII to include letters currency symbols The PETSCII code Commodore International used for their systems is probably unique among codes in being based on instead of the more common such as found on the ZX Spectrum computer Atari computers and Galaksija computers also used ASCII variants From early in its development ASCII was intended to be just one of several national variants of an international character code standard ultimately published as which would share most characters in common but assign other locally useful characters to several code points reserved for national use However the four years that elapsed between the publication of and ISO first acceptance of an international recommendation during caused ASCII choices for the national use characters to seem to be de facto standards for the world causing confusion and incompatibility once other countries did begin to make their own assignments to these code points like ASCII was a character set It did not make any additional codes available so the same code points encoded different characters in different countries Escape codes were defined to indicate which national variant applied to a piece of text but they were rarely used so it was often impossible to know what variant to work with and therefore which character a code represented and in general systems could cope with only one variant anyway Because the bracket and brace characters of ASCII were assigned to national use code points that were used for accented letters in other national variants of a German French or Swedish programmer using their national variant of rather than ASCII had to write and thus read something such as instead of C trigraphs were created to solve this problem for ANSI C although their late introduction and inconsistent implementation in compilers limited their use Many programmers kept their computers on so in Swedish German for example in or Usenet contained and similar variants in the middle of words something those programmers got used to Eventually as and and later computers began to replace and computers as the norm it became common to use an byte to store each character in memory providing an opportunity for extended relatives of ASCII In most cases these developed as true extensions of ASCII leaving the original intact but adding additional character definitions after the first characters Most early home computer systems developed their own character sets containing and game glyphs and often filled in some or all of the control characters from with more graphics Kaypro computers used the upper characters for the Greek alphabet The IBM PC defined code page which replaced the with graphic symbols such as smiley faces and mapped additional graphic characters to the upper positions Operating systems such as DOS supported these and manufacturers of IBM PCs supported them in hardware Digital Equipment Corporation developed the Multinational Character Set for use in the popular terminal this was one of the first extensions designed more for international languages than for block graphics The Macintosh defined Mac OS Roman and Postscript also defined a set both of these contained both international letters and typographic punctuation marks instead of graphics more like modern character sets The standard derived from the finally provided a standard that most systems copied at least as accurately as they copied ASCII but with many substitutions A popular further extension designed by Microsoft often mislabeled as added the typographic punctuation marks needed for traditional text printing and the original ASCII were the most common character encodings until when became more common Unicode Unicode and the Universal Character Set UCS have a much wider array of characters and their various encoding forms have begun to supplant and ASCII rapidly in many environments While ASCII is limited to characters Unicode and the UCS support more characters by separating the concepts of unique identification using natural numbers called code points and encoding to or binary formats called and To allow backward compatibility the ASCII and Latin characters are assigned code points that are the same as their codes in the earlier standards Therefore ASCII can be considered a encoding scheme for a very small subset of and ASCII when prefixed with as the eighth bit is valid Order order is also called ASCIIbetical order Collation of data is sometimes done in this order rather than standard alphabetical order collating sequence The main deviations in ASCII order are An intermediate order readily implemented converts uppercase letters to lowercase before comparing ASCII values Na ve number sorting can be averted by all numbers will sort before as expected although this is an external fix and has nothing to do with the ordering itself
