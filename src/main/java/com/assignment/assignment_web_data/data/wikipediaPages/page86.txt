battles of Monterrey and Buena Vista He remained on his plantation after the war until he was appointed by President Zachary Taylor to the Army as a major and was made a paymaster in December He served in that role for more than five years making six tours and traveling more than annually on the Indian frontier of Texas He served on the Texas frontier at Fort Mason and elsewhere in the West In President Franklin Pierce appointed him colonel of the new Cavalry the unit that preceded the modern a new regiment which he organized On August Persifor Smith at the request of Kansas Territorial Governor Wilson Shannon sent Johnston with men of the Cavalry Dragoons from Fort Riley troops from Jefferson Barracks a battalion of the Infantry and Howe artillery company to protect the territorial capital at Lecompton from an imminent attack by Jim Lane and his abolitionist Army of the North As a key figure in the Utah War Johnston led troops who established a government in the formerly Mormon territory He received a brevet promotion to brigadier general in for his service in Utah He spent in Kentucky until December when he sailed for California to take command of the Department of the Pacific Civil War At the outbreak of the Civil War Johnston was the commander of the Army Department of the Pacific in California Like many regular army officers from the South he was opposed to secession But he resigned his commission soon after he heard of the secession of his adopted state Texas It was accepted by the War Department on May effective May On April he moved to Los Angeles the home of his wife brother John Griffin Considering staying in California with his wife and five children Johnston remained there until May Soon under suspicion by local Union officials he evaded arrest and joined the Los Angeles Mounted Rifles as a private leaving Warner Ranch May He participated in their trek across the southwestern deserts to Texas crossing the Colorado River into the Confederate Territory of Arizona on July Early in the Civil War Confederate President Jefferson Davis decided that the Confederacy would attempt to hold as much of its territory as possible and he distributed its military forces around its borders and coasts In the summer of Davis appointed several generals to defend Confederate lines from the Mississippi River east to the Allegheny Mountains The most sensitive and in many ways the most crucial areas along the Mississippi River and in western Tennessee along the Tennessee and the Cumberland rivers were placed under the command of Leonidas Polk and Gideon Pillow The latter had initially been in command in Tennessee as that State top general Their impolitic occupation of Columbus Kentucky on September two days before Johnston arrived in the Confederacy capital of Richmond Virginia after his cross country journey drove Kentucky from its stated neutrality The majority of Kentuckians allied with the Union camp Polk and Pillow action gave Union Ulysses Grant an excuse to take control of the strategically located town of Paducah Kentucky without raising the ire of most Kentuckians and the majority in the State legislature Confederate command in Western Theater On September Johnston was assigned to command the huge area of the Confederacy west of the Allegheny Mountains except for coastal areas He became commander of the Confederacy western armies in the area often called the Western Department or Western Military Department After his appointment Johnston immediately headed for his new territory He was permitted to call on governors of Arkansas Tennessee and Mississippi for new troops although this authority was largely stifled by politics especially with respect to Mississippi On September Johnston ordered Felix Zollicoffer with men to occupy Cumberland Gap in Kentucky in order to block Union troops from coming into eastern Tennessee The Kentucky legislature had voted to side with the Union after the occupation of Columbus by Polk By September Johnston had Simon Bolivar Buckner with another men blocking the railroad route to Tennessee at Bowling Green Kentucky Johnston had fewer than men spread throughout Kentucky Tennessee Arkansas and Missouri Of these were in Missouri under Missouri State Guard Sterling Price Johnston did not quickly gain many recruits when he first requested them from the governors but his more serious problem was lacking sufficient arms and ammunition for the troops he already had As the Confederate government concentrated efforts on the units in the East they gave Johnston small numbers of reinforcements and minimal amounts of arms and material Johnston maintained his defense by conducting raids and other measures to make it appear he had larger forces than he did a strategy that worked for several months Johnston tactics had so annoyed and confused Union William Tecumseh Sherman that he became somewhat unnerved overestimated Johnston forces and had to be relieved by Don Carlos Buell on November Battle of Mill Springs Eastern Tennessee was held for the Confederacy by two unimpressive brigadier generals appointed by Jefferson Davis Felix Zollicoffer a brave but untrained and inexperienced officer and soon to be George Crittenden a former Army officer with apparent alcohol problems While Crittenden was away in Richmond Zollicoffer moved his forces to the north bank of the upper Cumberland River near Mill Springs now Nancy Kentucky putting the river to his back and his forces into a trap Zollicoffer decided it was impossible to obey orders to return to the other side of the river because of scarcity of transport and proximity of Union troops When Union George Thomas moved against the Confederates Crittenden decided to attack one of the two parts of Thomas command at Logan Cross Roads near Mill Springs before the Union forces could unite On January the Confederates after a night march in the rain attacked the Union force with some initial success As the battle progressed Zollicoffer was killed Crittenden was unable to lead the Confederate force he may have been intoxicated and the Confederates were turned back and routed by a Union bayonet charge suffering casualties from their force of The Confederate troops who escaped were assigned to other units as Crittenden faced an investigation of his conduct After this Confederate defeat at the Battle of Mill Springs Davis sent Johnston a brigade and a few other scattered reinforcements He also assigned him Beauregard who was supposed to attract recruits because of his victories early in the war and act as a competent subordinate for Johnston The brigade was led by John Floyd considered incompetent He took command at Fort Donelson as the senior general present just before Union Ulysses Grant attacked the fort Historians believe the assignment of Beauregard to the west stimulated Union commanders to attack the forts before Beauregard could make a difference in the theater Union officers heard that he was bringing regiments with him but this was an exaggeration of his forces Fort Henry Fort Donelson Nashville Based on the assumption that Kentucky neutrality would act as a shield against a direct invasion from the north Tennessee initially had sent men to Virginia and concentrated defenses in the Mississippi Valley circumstances that no longer applied in September Even before Johnston arrived in Tennessee construction of two forts had been started to defend the Tennessee and the Cumberland rivers which provided avenues into the State from the north Both forts were located in Tennessee in order to respect Kentucky neutrality but these were not in ideal locations Fort Henry on the Tennessee River was in an unfavorable low lying location commanded by hills on the Kentucky side of the river Fort Donelson on the Cumberland River although in a better location had a vulnerable land side and did not have enough heavy artillery to defend against gunboats Polk ignored the problems of the forts when he took command After Johnston took command Polk at first refused to comply with Johnston order to send an engineer Joseph Dixon to inspect the forts After Johnston asserted his authority Polk had to allow Dixon to proceed Dixon recommended that the forts be maintained and strengthened although they were not in ideal locations because much work had been done on them and the Confederates might not have time to build new ones Johnston accepted his recommendations Johnston wanted Major later Alexander Stewart to command the forts but President Davis appointed Lloyd Tilghman as commander To prevent Polk from dissipating his forces by allowing some men to join a partisan group Johnston ordered him to send Gideon Pillow and men to Fort Donelson Pillow took up a position at nearby Clarksville Tennessee and did not move into the fort until February Alerted by a Union reconnaissance on January Johnston ordered Tilghman to fortify the high ground opposite Fort Henry which Polk had failed to do despite Johnston orders Tilghman failed to act decisively on these orders which in any event were too late to be adequately carried out Beauregard arrived at Johnston headquarters at Bowling Green on February and was given overall command of Polk force at the western end of Johnston line at Columbus Kentucky On February Union Navy gunboats quickly reduced the defenses of Fort Henry inflicting casualties on the small remaining Confederate force Lloyd Tilghman surrendered the remaining officers and men of his approximately force which had not been sent to Fort Donelson before Grant force could even take up their positions Johnston knew he could be trapped at Bowling Green if Fort Donelson fell so he moved his force to Nashville the capital of Tennessee and an increasingly important Confederate industrial center beginning on February Johnston also reinforced Fort Donelson with more men including those under Floyd and Pillow a curious decision in view of his thought that the Union gunboats alone might be able to take the fort He did order the commanders of the fort to evacuate the troops if the fort could not be held The senior generals sent to the fort to command the enlarged garrison Gideon Pillow and John Floyd squandered their chance to avoid having to surrender most of the garrison and on February Simon Buckner having been abandoned by Floyd and Pillow surrendered Fort Donelson Colonel Nathan Bedford Forrest escaped with his cavalry force of about men before the surrender The Confederates suffered about casualties with an estimated to taken prisoner Union casualties were killed wounded missing Johnston who had little choice in allowing Floyd and Pillow to take charge at Fort Donelson on the basis of seniority after he ordered them to add their forces to the garrison took the blame and suffered calls for his removal because a full explanation to the press and public would have exposed the weakness of the Confederate position His passive defensive performance while positioning himself in a forward position at Bowling Green spreading his forces too thinly not concentrating his forces in the face of Union advances and appointing or relying upon inadequate or incompetent subordinates subjected him to criticism at the time and by later historians The fall of the forts exposed Nashville to imminent attack and it fell without resistance to Union forces under Buell on February two days after Johnston had to pull his forces out in order to avoid having them captured as well Concentration at Corinth Johnston had various remaining military units scattered throughout his territory and retreating to the south to avoid being cut off Johnston himself retreated with the force under his personal command the Army of Central Kentucky from the vicinity of Nashville With Beauregard help Johnston decided to concentrate forces with those formerly under Polk and now already under Beauregard command at the strategically located railroad crossroads of Corinth Mississippi which he reached by a circuitous route Johnston kept the Union forces now under the overall command of the ponderous Henry Halleck confused and hesitant to move allowing Johnston to reach his objective undetected This delay allowed Jefferson Davis finally to send reinforcements from the garrisons of coastal cities and another highly rated but prickly general Braxton Bragg to help organize the western forces Bragg at least calmed the nerves of Beauregard and Polk who had become agitated by their apparent dire situation in the face of numerically superior forces before the arrival of Johnston on March Johnston army of men gave the Confederates a combined force of about to men at Corinth On March Johnston officially took command of this combined force which continued to use the Army of the Mississippi name under which it had been organized by Beauregard on March Johnston now planned to defeat the Union forces piecemeal before the various Union units in Kentucky and Tennessee under Grant with men at nearby Pittsburg Landing Tennessee and the now Don Carlos Buell on his way from Nashville with men could unite against him Johnston started his army in motion on April intent on surprising Grant force as soon as the next day but they moved slowly due to their inexperience bad roads and lack of adequate staff planning Johnston army was finally in position within a mile or two of Grant force and undetected by the evening of April Battle of Shiloh and death Johnston launched a massive surprise attack with his concentrated forces against Grant at the Battle of Shiloh on April As the Confederate forces overran the Union camps Johnston seemed to be everywhere personally leading and rallying troops up and down the line on his horse At about while leading one of those charges against a Union camp near the Peach Orchard he was wounded taking a bullet behind his right knee He apparently did not think the wound was serious at the time or even possibly did not feel it and so he sent his personal physician away to attend to some wounded captured Union soldiers instead It is possible that Johnston duel in had caused nerve damage or numbness to his right leg and that he did not feel the wound to his leg as a result The bullet had in fact clipped a part of his popliteal artery and his boot was filling up with blood Within a few minutes Johnston was observed by his staff to be nearly fainting Among his staff was Isham Harris the Governor of Tennessee who had ceased to make any real effort to function as governor after learning that Abraham Lincoln had appointed Andrew Johnson as military governor of Tennessee Seeing Johnston slumping in his saddle and his face turning deathly pale Harris asked General are you wounded Johnston glanced down at his leg wound then faced Harris and replied in a weak voice his last words Yes and I fear seriously Harris and other staff officers removed Johnston from his horse and carried him to a small ravine near the Hornets Nest and desperately tried to aid the general by trying to make a tourniquet for his leg wound but little could be done by this point since he had already lost so much blood He soon lost consciousness and bled to death a few minutes later It is believed that Johnston may have lived for as long as one hour after receiving his fatal wound Harris and the other officers wrapped General Johnston body in a blanket so as not to damage the troops morale with the sight of the dead general Johnston and his wounded horse named Fire Eater were taken to his field headquarters on the Corinth road where his body remained in his tent until the Confederate Army withdrew to Corinth the next day April From there his body was taken to the home of Colonel William Inge which had been his headquarters in Corinth It was covered in the Confederate flag and lay in state for several hours It is probable that a Confederate soldier fired the fatal round No Union soldiers were observed to have ever gotten behind Johnston during the fatal charge while it is known that many Confederates were firing at the Union lines while Johnston charged well in advance of his soldiers Johnston was the casualty of the war on either side and his death was a strong blow to the morale of the Confederacy Jefferson Davis considered him the best general in the country this was two months before the emergence of Robert Lee as the general of the Confederacy Legacy and honors Johnston was survived by his wife Eliza and six children His wife and five younger children including one born after he went to war chose to live out their days at home in Los Angeles with Eliza brother John Strother Griffin Johnston eldest son Albert Sidney born in Texas had already followed him into the Confederate States Army In after taking home leave in Los Angeles Albert was on his way out of San Pedro harbor on a ferry While a steamer was taking on passengers from the ferry a wave swamped the smaller boat causing its boilers to explode Johnston was killed in the accident Killed in action General Johnston received the highest praise ever given by the Confederate government accounts were published on December and thereafter in the Los Angeles Star of his family hometown Johnston Street Hancock Street and Griffin Avenue each in northeast Los Angeles are named after the general and his family who lived in the neighborhood Johnston was initially buried in New Orleans In a joint resolution of the Texas Legislature was passed to have his body moved and reinterred at the Texas State Cemetery in Austin The occurred in Forty years later the state appointed Elisabet Ney to design a monument and sculpture of him to be erected at the gravesite The Texas Historical Commission has erected a historical marker near the entrance of what was once Johnston plantation An adjacent marker was erected by the San Jacinto Chapter of the Daughters of The Republic of Texas and the Lee Roberts and Davis Chapter of the United Daughters of the Confederate States of America The University of Texas at Austin has recognized Johnston with a statue on the South Mall
