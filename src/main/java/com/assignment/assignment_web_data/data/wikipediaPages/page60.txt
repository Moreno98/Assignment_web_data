Alkali metal The alkali metals are a group column in the periodic table consisting of the chemical elements lithium Li sodium Na potassium K rubidium Rb caesium Cs and francium Fr This group lies in the of the periodic table as all alkali metals have their outermost electron in an this electron configuration results in their characteristic properties The alkali metals provide the best example of group trends in properties in the periodic table with elements exhibiting homologous behaviour The alkali metals have very similar properties they are all shiny soft highly reactive metals at standard temperature and pressure and readily lose their outermost electron to form cations with charge They can all be cut easily with a knife due to their softness exposing a shiny surface that tarnishes rapidly in air due to oxidation by atmospheric moisture and oxygen Because of their high reactivity they must be stored under oil to prevent reaction with air and are found naturally only in salts and never as the free element In the modern IUPAC nomenclature the alkali metals comprise the group elements excluding hydrogen H which is nominally a group element but not normally considered to be an alkali metal as it rarely exhibits behaviour comparable to that of the alkali metals All the alkali metals react with water with the heavier alkali metals reacting more vigorously than the lighter ones All the discovered alkali metals occur in nature in order of abundance sodium is the most abundant followed by potassium lithium rubidium caesium and finally francium which is very rare due to its extremely high radioactivity and thus occurs only in traces due to its presence in natural decay chains Experiments have been conducted to attempt the synthesis of ununennium Uue which is likely to be the next member of the group but they have all met with failure However ununennium may not be an alkali metal due to relativistic effects which are predicted to have a large influence on the chemical properties of superheavy elements even if it does turn out to be an alkali metal it is predicted to have some differences in physical and chemical properties from its lighter homologues Most alkali metals have many different applications Two of the most applications of the pure elements are rubidium and caesium atomic clocks of which caesium atomic clocks are the most accurate and precise representation of time A common application of the compounds of sodium is the lamp which emits very efficient light Table salt or sodium chloride has been used since antiquity Sodium and potassium are also essential elements having major biological roles as electrolytes and although the other alkali metals are not essential they also have various effects on the body both beneficial and harmful TOC Properties Physical and chemical The physical and chemical properties of the alkali metals can be readily explained by their having an valence electron configuration which results in weak metallic bonding Hence all the alkali metals are soft and have low densities melting and boiling points as well as heats of sublimation vaporisation and dissociation They all crystallize in the cubic crystal structure and have distinctive flame colours because their outer s electron is very easily excited The configuration also results in the alkali metals having very large atomic and ionic radii as well as high thermal and electrical conductivity Their chemistry is dominated by the loss of their lone valence electron to form the oxidation state due to the ease of ionizing this electron and the very high second ionization energy Most of the chemistry has been observed only for the first five members of the group The chemistry of francium is not well established due to its extreme radioactivity thus the presentation of its properties here is limited The alkali metals are more similar to each other than the elements in any other group are to each other For instance when moving down the table all known alkali metals show increasing atomic radius decreasing electronegativity increasing reactivity and decreasing melting and boiling points as well as heats of fusion and vaporisation In general their densities increase when moving down the table with the exception that potassium is less dense than sodium One of the very few properties of the alkali metals that does not display a very smooth trend is their reduction potentials lithium value is anomalous being more negative than the others This is because the Li ion has a very high hydration energy in the gas phase though the lithium ion disrupts the structure of water significantly causing a higher change in entropy this high hydration energy is enough to make the reduction potentials indicate it as being the most electropositive alkali metal despite the difficulty of ionizing it in the gas phase The stable alkali metals are all metals except for caesium which has a golden tint it is one of only three metals that are clearly coloured the other two being copper and gold Their lustre tarnishes rapidly in air due to oxidation They all crystallize in the cubic crystal structure and have distinctive flame colours because their outer s electron is very easily excited All the alkali metals are highly reactive and are never found in elemental forms in nature Because of this they are usually stored in mineral oil or kerosene paraffin oil They react aggressively with the halogens to form the alkali metal halides which are white ionic crystalline compounds that are all soluble in water except lithium fluoride LiF The alkali metals also react with water to form strongly alkaline hydroxides and thus should be handled with great care The heavier alkali metals react more vigorously than the lighter ones for example when dropped into water caesium produces a larger explosion than potassium The alkali metals have the lowest first ionisation energies in their respective periods of the periodic table because of their low effective nuclear charge and the ability to attain a noble gas configuration by losing just one electron The second ionisation energy of all of the alkali metals is very high as it is in a full shell that is also closer to the nucleus thus they almost always lose a single electron forming cations The alkalides are an exception they are unstable compounds which contain alkali metals in a oxidation state which is very unusual as before the discovery of the alkalides the alkali metals were not expected to be able to form anions and were thought to be able to appear in salts only as cations The alkalide anions have filled which gives them more stability and allows them to exist All the stable alkali metals except lithium are known to be able to form alkalides and the alkalides have much theoretical interest due to their unusual stoichiometry and low ionisation potentials Alkalides are chemically similar to the electrides which are salts with trapped electrons acting as anions A particularly striking example of an alkalide is inverse sodium hydride a both ions being complexed as opposed to the usual sodium hydride Na H it is unstable in isolation due to its high energy resulting from the displacement of two electrons from hydrogen to sodium although several derivatives are predicted to be metastable or stable In aqueous solution the alkali metal ions form aqua ions of the formula where n is the solvation number Their coordination numbers and shapes agree well with those expected from their ionic radii In aqueous solution the water molecules directly attached to the metal ion are said to belong to the first coordination sphere also known as the first or primary solvation shell The bond between a water molecule and the metal ion is a dative covalent bond with the oxygen atom donating both electrons to the bond Each coordinated water molecule may be attached by hydrogen bonds to other water molecules The latter are said to reside in the second coordination sphere However for the alkali metal cations the second coordination sphere is not as the charge on the cation is not high enough to polarize the water molecules in the primary solvation shell enough for them to form strong hydrogen bonds with those in the second coordination sphere producing a more stable entity The solvation number for Li has been experimentally determined to be forming the tetrahedral Li while solvation numbers of to have been found for lithium aqua ions solvation numbers less than may be the result of the formation of contact and the higher solvation numbers may be interpreted in terms of water molecules that approach through a face of the tetrahedron though molecular dynamic simulations may indicate the existence of an octahedral hexaaqua ion There are also probably six water molecules in the primary solvation sphere of the sodium ion forming the octahedral Na ion While it was previously thought that the heavier alkali metals also formed octahedral hexaaqua ions it has since been found that potassium and rubidium probably form the and Rb ions which have the square antiprismatic structure and that caesium forms the Cs ion Lithium The chemistry of lithium shows several differences from that of the rest of the group as the small Li cation polarises anions and gives its compounds a more covalent character Lithium and magnesium have a diagonal relationship due to their similar atomic radii so that they show some similarities For example lithium forms a stable nitride a property common among all the alkaline earth metals magnesium group but unique among the alkali metals In addition among their respective groups only lithium and magnesium form covalent organometallic compounds LiMe and Lithium fluoride is the only alkali metal halide that is not soluble in water and lithium hydroxide is the only alkali metal hydroxide that is not deliquescent Conversely lithium perchlorate and other lithium salts with large anions that can not be polarized are much more stable than the analogous compounds of the other alkali metals probably because Li has a high solvation energy This effect also means that most simple lithium salts are commonly encountered in hydrated form because the anhydrous forms are extremely hygroscopic this allows salts like lithium chloride and lithium bromide to be used in dehumidifiers and Francium Francium is also predicted to show some differences due to its high atomic weight causing its electrons to travel at considerable fractions of the speed of light and thus making relativistic effects more prominent In contrast to the trend of decreasing electronegativities and ionisation energies of the alkali metals francium electronegativity and ionisation energy are predicted to be higher than caesium due to the relativistic stabilisation of the electrons also its atomic radius is expected to be abnormally low All known physical properties of francium also deviate from the clear trends going from lithium to caesium such as the first ionisation energy electron affinity and anion polarizability The CsFr molecule is also polarized as Cs Fr showing that the subshell of francium is much more strongly affected by relativistic effects than the subshell of caesium Additionally francium superoxide is expected to have covalent character unlike the other alkali metal superoxides because of bonding contributions from the electrons of francium Nuclear All the alkali metals have odd atomic numbers hence their isotopes must be either both proton and neutron number are odd or proton number is odd but neutron number is even nuclei have even mass numbers while nuclei have odd mass numbers primordial nuclides are rare because most nuclei are highly unstable with respect to beta decay because the decay products are and are therefore more strongly bound due to nuclear pairing effects Due to the great rarity of nuclei almost all the primordial isotopes of the alkali metals are the exceptions being the light stable isotope and the radioisotope and For a given odd mass number there can be only a single nuclide since there is not a difference in binding energy between and comparable to that between and leaving other nuclides of the same mass number isobars free to beta decay toward the nuclide An effect of the instability of an odd number of either type of nucleons is that elements such as the alkali metals tend to have fewer stable isotopes than elements Of the monoisotopic elements that have only a single stable isotope all but one have an odd atomic number and all but one also have an even number of neutrons Beryllium is the single exception to both rules due to its low atomic number All of the alkali metals except lithium and caesium have at least one naturally occurring radioisotope and are trace radioisotopes produced cosmogenically and have very long and thus occur naturally and all isotopes of francium are radioactive Caesium was also thought to be radioactive in the early century although it has no naturally occurring radioisotopes Francium had not been discovered yet at that time The natural radioisotope of potassium makes up about of natural potassium and thus natural potassium is weakly radioactive This natural radioactivity became a basis for a mistaken claim of the discovery for element the next alkali metal after caesium in with a of years is one of the two principal fission products along with which are responsible for most of the radioactivity of spent nuclear fuel after several years of cooling up to several hundred years after use It constitutes most of the radioactivity still left from the Chernobyl accident undergoes beta decay and eventually becomes stable It is a strong emitter of gamma radiation has a very low rate of neutron capture and can not be feasibly disposed of in this way but must be allowed to decay has been used as a tracer in hydrologic studies analogous to the use of tritium Small amounts of and were released into the environment during nearly all nuclear weapon tests and some nuclear accidents most notably the Goi nia accident and the Chernobyl disaster As of is the principal source of radiation in the zone of alienation around the Chernobyl nuclear power plant Compounds Hydroxides All the alkali metals react vigorously or explosively with cold water producing an aqueous solution of the strongly basic alkali metal hydroxide and releasing hydrogen gas This reaction becomes more vigorous going down the group lithium reacts steadily with effervescence but sodium and potassium can ignite and rubidium and caesium sink in water and generate hydrogen gas so rapidly that shock waves form in the water that may shatter glass containers When an alkali metal is dropped into water it produces an explosion of which there are two separate stages The metal reacts with the water first breaking the hydrogen bonds in the water and producing hydrogen gas this takes place faster for the more reactive heavier alkali metals Second the heat generated by the first part of the reaction often ignites the hydrogen gas causing it to burn explosively into the surrounding air This secondary hydrogen gas explosion produces the visible flame above the bowl of water lake or other body of water not the initial reaction of the metal with water which tends to happen mostly under water The alkali metal hydroxides are the most basic known hydroxides Compounds with the group elements Lithium and sodium react with carbon to form acetylides and which can also be obtained by reaction of the metal with acetylene Potassium rubidium and caesium react with graphite their atoms are intercalated between the hexagonal graphite layers forming graphite intercalation compounds of formulae dark grey almost black dark grey almost black blue steel blue and bronze M K Rb or Cs These compounds are over times more electrically conductive than pure graphite suggesting that the valence electron of the alkali metal is transferred to the graphite layers Upon heating of the elimination of potassium atoms results in the conversion in sequence to and finally is a very strong reducing agent and is pyrophoric and explodes on contact with water While the large alkali metals K Rb and Cs initially form the smaller ones initially form When the alkali metals react with the heavier elements in the carbon group ionic substances with structures are formed such as the silicide M K Rb or Cs which contains M and tetrahedral ions The chemistry of alkali metal germanides involving the germanide ion and other cluster Zintl ions such as and is largely analogous to that of the corresponding silicides Alkali metal stannides are mostly ionic sometimes with the stannide ion and sometimes with more complex Zintl ions such as which appears in tetrapotassium nonastannide The monatomic plumbide ion is unknown and indeed its formation is predicted to be energetically unfavourable alkali metal plumbides have complex Zintl ions such as Nitrides and pnictides Lithium the lightest of the alkali metals is the only alkali metal which reacts with nitrogen at standard conditions and its nitride is the only stable alkali metal nitride Nitrogen is an unreactive gas because breaking the strong triple bond in the dinitrogen molecule requires a lot of energy The formation of an alkali metal nitride would consume the ionisation energy of the alkali metal forming M ions the energy required to break the triple bond in and the formation of ions and all the energy released from the formation of an alkali metal nitride is from the lattice energy of the alkali metal nitride The lattice energy is maximised with small highly charged ions the alkali metals do not form highly charged ions only forming ions with a charge of so only lithium the smallest alkali metal can release enough lattice energy to make the reaction with nitrogen exothermic forming lithium nitride The reactions of the other alkali metals with nitrogen would not release enough lattice energy and would thus be endothermic so they do not form nitrides at standard conditions Sodium nitride and potassium nitride while existing are extremely unstable being prone to decomposing back into their constituent elements and can not be produced by reacting the elements with each other at standard conditions All the alkali metals react readily with phosphorus and arsenic to form phosphides and arsenides with the formula where M represents an alkali metal and Pn represents a pnictogen This is due to the greater size of the and ions so that less lattice energy needs to be released for the salts to form These are not the only phosphides and arsenides of the alkali metals for example potassium has nine different known phosphides with formulae KP and While most metals form arsenides only the alkali and alkaline earth metals form mostly ionic arsenides The structure of is complex with unusually short Na Na distances of pm which are shorter than in sodium metal and this indicates that even with these electropositive metals the bonding can not be straightforwardly ionic Other alkali metal arsenides not conforming to the formula are known such as LiAs which has a metallic lustre and electrical conductivity indicating the presence of some metallic bonding The antimonides are unstable and reactive as the ion is a strong reducing agent reaction of them with acids form the toxic and unstable gas stibine Bismuthides are not even wholly ionic they are intermetallic compounds containing partially metallic and partially ionic bonds Oxides and chalcogenides All the alkali metals react vigorously with oxygen at standard conditions They form various types of oxides such as simple oxides containing the ion peroxides containing the ion where there is a single bond between the two oxygen atoms superoxides containing the ion and many others Lithium burns in air to form lithium oxide but sodium reacts with oxygen to form a mixture of sodium oxide and sodium peroxide Potassium forms a mixture of potassium peroxide and potassium superoxide while rubidium and caesium form the superoxide exclusively Their reactivity increases going down the group while lithium sodium and potassium merely burn in air rubidium and caesium are pyrophoric spontaneously catch fire in air The smaller alkali metals tend to polarise the more complex anions the peroxide and superoxide due to their small size This attracts the electrons in the more complex anions towards one of its constituent oxygen atoms forming an oxide ion and an oxygen atom This causes lithium to form the oxide exclusively on reaction with oxygen at room temperature This effect becomes drastically weaker for the larger sodium and potassium allowing them to form the less stable peroxides Rubidium and caesium at the bottom of the group are so large that even the least stable superoxides can form Because the superoxide releases the most energy when formed the superoxide is preferentially formed for the larger alkali metals where the more complex anions are not polarised The oxides and peroxides for these alkali metals do exist but do not form upon direct reaction of the metal with oxygen at standard conditions In addition the small size of the Li and ions contributes to their forming a stable ionic lattice structure Under controlled conditions however all the alkali metals with the exception of francium are known to form their oxides peroxides and superoxides The alkali metal peroxides and superoxides are powerful oxidizing agents Sodium peroxide and potassium superoxide react with carbon dioxide to form the alkali metal carbonate and oxygen gas which allows them to be used in submarine air purifiers the presence of water vapour naturally present in breath makes the removal of carbon dioxide by potassium superoxide even more efficient All the stable alkali metals except lithium can form red ozonides through reaction of the powdered anhydrous hydroxide with ozone the ozonides may be then extracted using liquid ammonia Rubidium and caesium can form even more complicated oxides than the superoxides Rubidium can form and upon oxidation in air while caesium forms an immense variety of oxides such as the ozonide and several brightly coloured suboxides such as CsO as well as The latter may be heated under vacuum to generate The alkali metals can also react analogously with the heavier chalcogens sulfur selenium tellurium and polonium and all the alkali metal chalcogenides are known with the exception of francium Reaction with an excess of the chalcogen can similarly result in lower chalcogenides with chalcogen ions containing chains of the chalcogen atoms in question For example sodium can react with sulfur to form the sulfide and various polysulfides with the formula x x from to containing the ions Due to the basicity of the and ions the alkali metal selenides and tellurides are alkaline in solution when reacted directly with selenium and tellurium alkali metal polyselenides and polytellurides are formed along with the selenides and tellurides with the and ions The alkali metal polonides are all ionic compounds containing the ion they are very chemically stable and can be produced by direct reaction of the elements at around Hydrides and halides The alkali metals are among the most electropositive elements on the periodic table and thus tend to bond ionically to the most electronegative elements on the periodic table the halogens forming salts known as the alkali metal halides The reaction is very vigorous and can sometimes result in explosions This includes sodium chloride otherwise known as common salt The reactivity becomes higher from lithium to caesium and drops from fluorine to iodine All of the alkali metal halides have the formula MX where M is an alkali metal and X is a halogen They are all white ionic crystalline solids All the alkali metal halides are soluble in water except for lithium fluoride LiF which is insoluble in water due to its very high lattice enthalpy The high lattice enthalpy of lithium fluoride is due to the small sizes of the Li and F ions causing the electrostatic interactions between them to be strong a similar effect occurs for magnesium fluoride which lithium has a diagonal relationship with The alkali metals also react similarly with hydrogen to form ionic alkali metal hydrides Coordination complexes Alkali metal cations do not usually form coordination complexes with simple Lewis bases due to their low charge of just and their relatively large size thus the Li ion forms most complexes and the heavier alkali metal ions form less and less In aqueous solution the alkali metal ions exist as octahedral hexahydrate complexes with the exception of the lithium ion which due to its small size forms tetrahedral tetrahydrate complexes Li the alkali metals form these complexes because their ions are attracted by electrostatic forces of attraction to the polar water molecules Because of this anhydrous salts containing alkali metal cations are often used as desiccants Alkali metals also readily form complexes with crown ethers for Li for Na and for K and cryptands due to electrostatic attraction Ammonia solutions Unlike most metals the alkali metals dissolve slowly in liquid ammonia forming hydrogen gas and the alkali metal amide where M represents an alkali metal this was first noted by Humphry Davy in and rediscovered by Weyl in The process may be speeded up by a catalyst The amide salt is quite insoluble and readily precipitates out of solution leaving intensely coloured ammonia solutions of the alkali metals In Charles Krause identified the colour as being due to the presence of solvated electrons which contribute to the high electrical conductivity of these solutions At low concentrations below M the solution is dark blue and has ten times the conductivity of aqueous sodium chloride at higher concentrations above M the solution is and has approximately the conductivity of liquid metals like mercury In addition to the alkali metal amide salt and solvated electrons such ammonia solutions also contain the alkali metal cation M the neutral alkali metal atom M diatomic alkali metal molecules and alkali metal anions M These are unstable and eventually become the more thermodynamically stable alkali metal amide and hydrogen gas Solvated electrons are powerful reducing agents and are often used in chemical synthesis Organometallic Being the smallest alkali metal lithium forms the widest variety of and most stable organometallic compounds which are bonded covalently Organolithium compounds are electrically volatile solids or liquids that melt at low temperatures and tend to form oligomers with the structure RLi x where R is the organic group As the electropositive nature of lithium puts most of the charge density of the bond on the carbon atom effectively creating a carbanion organolithium compounds are extremely powerful bases and nucleophiles For use as bases butyllithiums are often used and are commercially available An example of an organolithium compound is methyllithium x which exists in tetrameric x and hexameric x forms The application of organosodium compounds in chemistry is limited in part due to competition from organolithium compounds which are commercially available and exhibit more convenient reactivity The principal organosodium compound of commercial importance is sodium cyclopentadienide Sodium tetraphenylborate can also be classified as an organosodium compound since in the solid state sodium is bound to the aryl groups Organometallic compounds of the higher alkali metals are even more reactive than organosodium compounds and of limited utility A notable reagent is Schlosser base a mixture of n butyllithium and potassium tert butoxide This reagent reacts with propene to form the compound allylpotassium cis Butene and trans butene equilibrate when in contact with alkali metals Whereas isomerization is fast with lithium and sodium it is slow with the higher alkali metals The higher alkali metals also favour the sterically congested conformation Several crystal structures of organopotassium compounds have been reported establishing that they like the sodium compounds are polymeric Organosodium organopotassium organorubidium and organocaesium compounds are all mostly ionic and are insoluble or nearly so in nonpolar solvents Extensions Although francium is the heaviest alkali metal that has been discovered there has been some theoretical work predicting the physical and chemical characteristics of the hypothetical heavier alkali metals Being the first period element the undiscovered element ununennium element is predicted to be the next alkali metal after francium and behave much like their lighter congeners however it is also predicted to differ from the lighter alkali metals in some properties Its chemistry is predicted to be closer to that of potassium or rubidium instead of caesium or francium This is unusual as periodic trends ignoring relativistic effects would predict ununennium to be even more reactive than caesium and francium This lowered reactivity is due to the relativistic stabilisation of ununennium valence electron increasing ununennium first ionisation energy and decreasing the metallic and ionic radii this effect is already seen for francium This assumes that ununennium will behave chemically as an alkali metal which although likely may not be true due to relativistic effects The relativistic stabilisation of the orbital also increases ununennium electron affinity far beyond that of caesium and francium indeed ununennium is expected to have an electron affinity higher than all the alkali metals lighter than it Relativistic effects also cause a very large drop in the polarisability of ununennium On the other hand ununennium is predicted to continue the trend of melting points decreasing going down the group being expected to have a melting point between C and C The stabilisation of ununennium valence electron and thus the contraction of the orbital cause its atomic radius to be lowered to pm very close to that of rubidium pm so that the chemistry of ununennium in the oxidation state should be more similar to the chemistry of rubidium than to that of francium On the other hand the ionic radius of the Uue ion is predicted to be larger than that of Rb because the orbitals are destabilised and are thus larger than the of the lower shells Ununennium may also show the oxidation state which is not seen in any other alkali metal in addition to the oxidation state that is characteristic of the other alkali metals and is also the main oxidation state of all the known alkali metals this is because of the destabilisation and expansion of the spinor causing its outermost electrons to have a lower ionisation energy than what would otherwise be expected Indeed many ununennium compounds are expected to have a large covalent character due to the involvement of the electrons in the bonding Not as much work has been done predicting the properties of the alkali metals beyond ununennium Although a simple extrapolation of the periodic table would put element unhexennium under ununennium calculations predict that the next alkali metal after ununennium may actually be element unhexpentium which is predicted to have the electron configuration Further calculations show that unhexpentium would follow the trend of increasing ionisation energy beyond caesium having an ionisation energy comparable to that of sodium and that it should also continue the trend of decreasing atomic radii beyond caesium having an atomic radius comparable to that of potassium However the electrons of unhexpentium may also be able to participate in chemical reactions along with the electron possibly allowing oxidation states beyond and perhaps even making unhexpentium behave more like a boron group element or group element than an alkali metal Due to the alkali and alkaline earth metals both being elements these predictions for the trends and properties of ununennium and unhexpentium also mostly hold quite similarly for the corresponding alkaline earth metals unbinilium Ubn and unhexhexium Uhh The probable properties of further alkali metals beyond unhexpentium have not been explored yet as of In periods and above of the periodic table relativistic and effects become so strong that extrapolations from lighter congeners become completely inaccurate In addition the relativistic and effects which stabilise the and destabilise and expand the d f and of higher shells have opposite effects causing even larger difference between relativistic and calculations of the properties of elements with such high atomic numbers Interest in the chemical properties of ununennium and unhexpentium stems from the fact that both elements are located close to the expected locations of islands of stabilities centered at elements and Other similar substances Hydrogen The element hydrogen with one electron per neutral atom is usually placed at the top of Group of the periodic table for convenience but hydrogen is not normally considered to be an alkali metal when it is considered to be an alkali metal it is because of its atomic properties and not its chemical properties Under typical conditions pure hydrogen exists as a diatomic gas consisting of two atoms per molecule however the alkali metals only form diatomic molecules such as dilithium at high temperatures when they are in the gaseous state Hydrogen like the alkali metals has one valence electron and reacts easily with the halogens but the similarities end there Its placement above lithium is primarily due to its electron configuration and not its chemical properties It is sometimes placed above carbon due to their similar electronegativities or fluorine due to their similar chemical properties The first ionisation energy of hydrogen is much higher than that of the alkali metals As only one additional electron is required to fill in the outermost shell of the hydrogen atom hydrogen often behaves like a halogen forming the negative hydride ion and is sometimes considered to be a halogen The alkali metals can also form negative ions known as alkalides but these are little more than laboratory curiosities being unstable It was expected for some time that liquid hydrogen would show metallic properties while this has been shown to not be the case under extremely high pressures such as those found at the cores of Jupiter and Saturn hydrogen does become metallic and behaves like an alkali metal in this phase it is known as metallic hydrogen The electrical resistivity of liquid metallic hydrogen at K is approximately equal to that of liquid rubidium and caesium at K at the respective pressures when they undergo a transition The electron configuration of hydrogen while superficially similar to that of the alkali metals is unique because there is no subshell Hence it can lose an electron to form the hydron H or gain one to form the hydride ion H In the former case it resembles superficially the alkali metals in the latter case the halogens but the differences due to the lack of a subshell are important enough that neither group fits the properties of hydrogen well Group is the best fit in terms of thermodynamic properties such as ionization energy and electron affinity but none of the three placements are entirely satisfactory As an example of hydrogen unorthodox properties stemming from its unusual electron configuration and small size the hydrogen ion is very small radius around fm compared to the pm size of most other atoms and ions and so is nonexistent in condensed systems other than in association with other atoms or molecules Indeed transferring of protons between chemicals is the basis of chemistry Also unique is hydrogen ability to form hydrogen bonds which are an effect of electrostatic and electron correlative contributing phenomena While analogous lithium bonds are also known they are mostly electrostatic Nevertheless hydrogen can perform the same structural role as the alkali metals in some molecular crystals and has a close relationship with the lightest alkali metals especially lithium Ammonium The ammonium ion has very similar properties to the heavier alkali metals acting as an alkali metal intermediate between potassium and rubidium and is often considered a close relative For example most alkali metal salts are soluble in water a property which ammonium salts share Ammonium is expected to behave stably as a metal ions in a sea of electrons at very high pressures though less than the typical pressure where transitions from insulating to metallic behaviour occur around GPa and could possibly occur inside the ice giants Uranus and Neptune which may have significant impacts on their interior magnetic fields It has been estimated that the transition from a mixture of ammonia and dihydrogen molecules to metallic ammonium may occur at pressures just below GPa Thallium Thallium displays the oxidation state that all the known alkali metals display and thallium compounds with thallium in its oxidation state closely resemble the corresponding potassium or silver compounds stoichiometrically due to the similar ionic radii of the Tl pm K pm and Ag pm ions It was sometimes considered an alkali metal in continental Europe but not in England in the years immediately following its discovery and was placed just after caesium as the sixth alkali metal in Dmitri Mendeleev periodic table and Julius Lothar Meyer periodic table Mendeleev periodic table and Meyer periodic table put thallium in its current position in the boron group and leave the space below caesium blank However thallium also displays the oxidation state which no known alkali metal displays although ununennium the undiscovered seventh alkali metal is predicted to possibly display the oxidation state The sixth alkali metal is now considered to be francium While Tl is stabilized by the inert pair effect this inert pair of electrons is still able to participate chemically so that these electrons are stereochemically active in aqueous solution Additionally the thallium halides except TlF are quite insoluble in water and TlI has an unusual structure because of the presence of the inert pair in thallium Copper silver and gold The group metals or coinage metals copper silver and gold are typically categorised as transition metals given they can form ions with incomplete Physically they have the relatively low melting points and high electronegativity values associated with metals The filled d subshell and free s electron of Cu Ag and Au contribute to their high electrical and thermal conductivity Transition metals to the left of group experience interactions between s electrons and the partially filled d subshell that lower electron mobility Chemically the group metals behave like metals in their valence states and are hence somewhat related to the alkali metals this is one reason for their previously being labelled as group IB paralleling the alkali metals group IA They are occasionally classified as metals Their spectra are however analogous to those of the alkali metals In Mendeleev periodic table copper silver and gold are listed twice once under group VIII with the iron triad and platinum group metals and once under group IB Group IB was nonetheless parenthesized to note that it was tentative Mendeleev main criterion for group assignment was the maximum oxidation state of an element on that basis the group elements could not be classified in group IB due to the existence of Cu II and Au III compounds being known at that time However eliminating group IB would make group I the only main group group VIII was labelled a transition group to lack an A B bifurcation Soon afterwards a majority of chemists chose to classify these elements in group IB and remove them from group VIII for the resulting symmetry this was the predominant classification until the rise of the modern periodic table which separated the alkali metals and group metals The coinage metals were traditionally regarded as a subdivision of the alkali metal group due to them sharing the characteristic electron configuration of the alkali metals group group However the similarities are largely confined to the stochiometries of the compounds of both groups and not their chemical properties This stems from the filled d subshell providing a much weaker shielding effect on the outermost s electron than the filled p subshell so that the coinage metals have much higher first ionization energies and smaller ionic radii than do the corresponding alkali metals Furthermore they have higher melting points hardnesses and densities and lower reactivities and solubilities in liquid ammonia as well as having more covalent character in their compounds Finally the alkali metals are at the top of the electrochemical series whereas the coinage metals are almost at the very bottom The coinage metals filled d shell is much more easily disrupted than the alkali metals filled p shell so that the second and third ionization energies are lower enabling higher oxidation states than and a richer coordination chemistry thus giving the group metals clear transition metal character Particularly noteworthy is gold forming ionic compounds with rubidium and caesium in which it forms the auride ion Au which also occurs in solvated form in liquid ammonia solution here gold behaves as a pseudohalogen because its configuration has one electron less than the shell configuration of mercury History Sodium compounds have been known since ancient times salt sodium chloride has been an important commodity in human activities as testified by the English word salary referring to salarium the wafers of salt sometimes given to Roman soldiers along with their other wages In medieval Europe a compound of sodium with the Latin name of sodanum was used as a headache remedy While potash has been used since ancient times it was not understood for most of its history to be a fundamentally different substance from sodium mineral salts Georg Ernst Stahl obtained experimental evidence which led him to suggest the fundamental difference of sodium and potassium salts in and Henri Louis Duhamel du Monceau was able to prove this difference in The exact chemical composition of potassium and sodium compounds and the status as chemical element of potassium and sodium was not known then and thus Antoine Lavoisier did include the alkali in his list of chemical elements in Pure potassium was first isolated in in England by Sir Humphry Davy who derived it from caustic potash KOH potassium hydroxide by the use of electrolysis of the molten salt with the newly invented voltaic pile Previous attempts at electrolysis of the aqueous salt were unsuccessful due to potassium extreme reactivity Potassium was the first metal that was isolated by electrolysis Later that same year Davy reported extraction of sodium from the similar substance caustic soda NaOH lye by a similar technique demonstrating the elements and thus the salts to be different Later that year the first pieces of pure molten sodium metal were similarly prepared by Humphry Davy through the electrolysis of molten caustic soda now called sodium hydroxide Petalite was discovered in by the Brazilian chemist Jos Bonif cio de Andrada in a mine on the island of Ut Sweden However it was not until that Johan August Arfwedson then working in the laboratory of the chemist J ns Jacob Berzelius detected the presence of a new element while analysing petalite ore This new element was noted by him to form compounds similar to those of sodium and potassium though its carbonate and hydroxide were less soluble in water and more alkaline than the other alkali metals Berzelius gave the unknown material the name lithion lithina from the Greek word o transliterated as lithos meaning stone to reflect its discovery in a solid mineral as opposed to potassium which had been discovered in plant ashes and sodium which was known partly for its high abundance in animal blood He named the metal inside the material lithium Lithium sodium and potassium were part of the discovery of periodicity as they are among a series of triads of elements in the same group that were noted by Johann Wolfgang D bereiner in as having similar properties Rubidium and caesium were the first elements to be discovered using the spectroscope invented in by Robert Bunsen and Gustav Kirchhoff The next year they discovered caesium in the mineral water from Bad D rkheim Germany Their discovery of rubidium came the following year in Heidelberg Germany finding it in the mineral lepidolite The names of rubidium and caesium come from the most prominent lines in their emission spectra a bright red line for rubidium from the Latin word rubidus meaning dark red or bright red and a line for caesium derived from the Latin word caesius meaning Around John Newlands produced a series of papers where he listed the elements in order of increasing atomic weight and similar physical and chemical properties that recurred at intervals of eight he likened such periodicity to the octaves of music His version put all the alkali metals then known lithium to caesium as well as copper silver and thallium which show the oxidation state characteristic of the alkali metals together into a group His table placed hydrogen with the halogens After Dmitri Mendeleev proposed his periodic table placing lithium at the top of a group with sodium potassium rubidium caesium and thallium Two years later Mendeleev revised his table placing hydrogen in group above lithium and also moving thallium to the boron group In this version copper silver and gold were placed twice once as part of group IB and once as part of a group VIII encompassing today groups to After the introduction of the table the group IB elements were moved to their current position in the while alkali metals were left in group IA Later the group name was changed to group in The trivial name alkali metals comes from the fact that the hydroxides of the group elements are all strong alkalis when dissolved in water There were at least four erroneous and incomplete discoveries before Marguerite Perey of the Curie Institute in Paris France discovered francium in by purifying a sample of which had been reported to have a decay energy of keV However Perey noticed decay particles with an energy level below keV Perey thought this decay activity might have been caused by a previously unidentified decay product one that was separated during purification but emerged again out of the pure Various tests eliminated the possibility of the unknown element being thorium radium lead bismuth or thallium The new product exhibited chemical properties of an alkali metal such as coprecipitating with caesium salts which led Perey to believe that it was element caused by the alpha decay of Perey then attempted to determine the proportion of beta decay to alpha decay in Her first test put the alpha branching at a figure that she later revised to It was the last element discovered in nature rather than by synthesis The next element below francium is very likely to be ununennium Uue element although this is not completely certain due to relativistic effects The synthesis of ununennium was first attempted in by bombarding a target of with ions at the superHILAC accelerator at Berkeley California No atoms were identified leading to a limiting yield of nb It is highly unlikely that this reaction will be able to create any atoms of ununennium in the near future given the extremely difficult task of making sufficient amounts of which is favoured for production of ultraheavy elements because of its large mass relatively long of days and availability in significant amounts of several micrograms to make a large enough target to increase the sensitivity of the experiment to the required level einsteinium has not been found in nature and has only been produced in laboratories However given that ununennium is only the first period element on the extended periodic table it may well be discovered in the near future through other reactions indeed another attempt to synthesise ununennium by bombarding a berkelium target with titanium ions is under way at the GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research in Darmstadt Germany Currently none of the period elements have been discovered yet and it is also possible due to drip instabilities that only the lower period elements up to around element are physically possible No attempts at synthesis have been made for any heavier alkali metals such as unhexpentium due to their extremely high atomic number Occurrence In the Solar System The rule holds that elements with even atomic numbers are more common that those with odd atomic numbers with the exception of hydrogen This rule argues that elements with odd atomic numbers have one unpaired proton and are more likely to capture another thus increasing their atomic number In elements with even atomic numbers protons are paired with each member of the pair offsetting the spin of the other enhancing stability All the alkali metals have odd atomic numbers and they are not as common as the elements with even atomic numbers adjacent to them the noble gases and the alkaline earth metals in the Solar System The heavier alkali metals are also less abundant than the lighter ones as the alkali metals from rubidium onward can only be synthesized in supernovae and not in stellar nucleosynthesis Lithium is also much less abundant than sodium and potassium as it is poorly synthesized in both Big Bang nucleosynthesis and in stars the Big Bang could only produce trace quantities of lithium beryllium and boron due to the absence of a stable nucleus with or nucleons and stellar nucleosynthesis could only pass this bottleneck by the process fusing three helium nuclei to form carbon and skipping over those three elements On Earth The Earth formed from the same cloud of matter that formed the Sun but the planets acquired different compositions during the formation and evolution of the solar system In turn the natural history of the Earth caused parts of this planet to have differing concentrations of the elements The mass of the Earth is approximately kg It is composed mostly of iron oxygen silicon magnesium sulfur nickel calcium and aluminium with the remaining consisting of trace amounts of other elements Due to mass segregation the core region is believed to be primarily composed of iron with smaller amounts of nickel sulfur and less than trace elements The alkali metals due to their high reactivity do not occur naturally in pure form in nature They are lithophiles and therefore remain close to the Earth surface because they combine readily with oxygen and so associate strongly with silica forming relatively minerals that do not sink down into the Earth core Potassium rubidium and caesium are also incompatible elements due to their large ionic radii Sodium and potassium are very abundant in earth both being among the ten most common elements in Earth crust sodium makes up approximately of the Earth crust measured by weight making it the sixth most abundant element overall and the most abundant alkali metal Potassium makes up approximately of the Earth crust and is the seventh most abundant element Sodium is found in many different minerals of which the most common is ordinary salt sodium chloride which occurs in vast quantities dissolved in seawater Other solid deposits include halite amphibole cryolite nitratine and zeolite Many of these solid deposits occur as a result of ancient seas evaporating which still occurs now in places such as Utah Great Salt Lake and the Dead Sea Despite their abundance in Earth crust sodium is far more common than potassium in the ocean both because potassium larger size makes its salts less soluble and because potassium is bound by silicates in soil and what potassium leaches is absorbed far more readily by plant life than sodium Despite its chemical similarity lithium typically does not occur together with sodium or potassium due to its smaller size Due to its relatively low reactivity it can be found in seawater in large amounts it is estimated that seawater is approximately to parts per million ppm or micromolar Its diagonal relationship with magnesium often allows it to replace magnesium in ferromagnesium minerals where its crustal concentration is about ppm comparable to that of gallium and niobium Commercially the most important lithium mineral is spodumene which occurs in large deposits worldwide Rubidium is approximately as abundant as zinc and more abundant than copper It occurs naturally in the minerals leucite pollucite carnallite zinnwaldite and lepidolite although none of these contain only rubidium and no other alkali metals Caesium is more abundant than some commonly known elements such as antimony cadmium tin and tungsten but is much less abundant than rubidium the only naturally occurring isotope of francium is the product of the alpha decay of and can be found in trace amounts in uranium and thorium minerals In a given sample of uranium there is estimated to be only one francium atom for every uranium atoms It has been calculated that there is at most g of francium in the earth crust at any time due to its extremely short of minutes Production and isolation The production of pure alkali metals is difficult due to their extreme reactivity with commonly used substances such as water The alkali metals are so reactive that they can not be displaced by other elements and must be isolated through methods such as electrolysis Lithium salts have to be extracted from the water of mineral springs brine pools and brine deposits The metal is produced electrolytically from a mixture of fused lithium chloride and potassium chloride Potassium occurs in many minerals such as sylvite potassium chloride It is occasionally produced through separating the potassium from the chlorine in potassium chloride but is more often produced through electrolysis of potassium hydroxide found extensively in places such as Canada Russia Belarus Germany Israel United States and Jordan in a method similar to how sodium was produced in the late and early It can also be produced from seawater Sodium occurs mostly in seawater and dried seabed but is now produced through electrolysis of sodium chloride by lowering the melting point of the substance to below C through the use of a Downs cell Extremely pure sodium can be produced through the thermal decomposition of sodium azide For several years in the and a of the potassium production called Alkarb was a main source for rubidium Alkarb contained rubidium while the rest was potassium and a small fraction of caesium Today the largest producers of caesium for example the Tanco Mine Manitoba Canada produce rubidium as from pollucite Today a common method for separating rubidium from potassium and caesium is the fractional crystallization of a rubidium and caesium alum Cs Rb Al which yields pure rubidium alum after approximately different reactions The limited applications and the lack of a mineral rich in rubidium limits the production of rubidium compounds to to tonnes per year Caesium however is not produced from the above reaction Instead the mining of pollucite ore is the main method of obtaining pure caesium extracted from the ore mainly by three methods acid digestion alkaline decomposition and direct reduction Both metals are produced as of lithium production after when interest in lithium thermonuclear properties increased sharply the production of rubidium and caesium also increased correspondingly the only naturally occurring isotope of francium is produced naturally as the product of the alpha decay of Francium can be found in trace amounts in uranium and thorium minerals it has been calculated that at most there are g of francium in the earth crust at any given time As a result of its extreme rarity in nature most francium is synthesized in the nuclear reaction n yielding and The greatest quantity of francium ever assembled to date is about neutral atoms which were synthesized using the nuclear reaction given above From their silicate ores all the alkali metals may be obtained the same way sulfuric acid is first used to dissolve the desired alkali metal ion and aluminium III ions from the ore leaching whereupon basic precipitation removes aluminium ions from the mixture by precipitating it as the hydroxide The remaining insoluble alkali metal carbonate is then precipitated selectively the salt is then dissolved in hydrochloric acid The result is then left to evaporate and the alkali metal can then be isolated through electrolysis Lithium and sodium are typically isolated through electrolysis from their liquid chlorides with calcium chloride typically added to lower the melting point of the mixture The heavier alkali metals however is more typically isolated in a different way where a reducing agent typically sodium for potassium and magnesium or calcium for the heaviest alkali metals is used to reduce the alkali metal chloride The liquid or gaseous product the alkali metal then undergoes fractional distillation for purification Applications All of the discovered alkali metals excluding francium have many applications Lithium is often used in batteries and lithium oxide can help process silica Lithium can also be used to make lubricating greases air treatment and aluminium production Pure sodium has many applications including use in lamps which produce very efficient light compared to other types of lighting and can help smooth the surface of other metals Being a strong reducing agent it is often used to reduce many other metals such as titanium and zirconium from their chlorides Sodium compounds have many applications as well the most compound being table salt Sodium is also used in soap as salts of fatty acids Potassium compounds are often used as fertilisers as potassium is an important element for plant nutrition Other potassium ions are often used to hold anions Potassium hydroxide is a very strong base and is used to control the pH of various substances Rubidium and caesium are often used in atomic clocks Caesium atomic clocks are extraordinarily accurate if a clock had been made at the time of the dinosaurs it would be off by less than four seconds after million years For that reason caesium atoms are used as the definition of the second Rubidium ions are often used in purple fireworks and caesium is often used in drilling fluids in the petroleum industry Francium has no commercial applications but because of francium relatively simple atomic structure among other things it has been used in spectroscopy experiments leading to more information regarding energy levels and the coupling constants between subatomic particles Studies on the light emitted by ions have provided accurate data on transitions between atomic energy levels similar to those predicted by quantum theory Biological role and precautions Lithium naturally only occurs in traces in biological systems and has no known biological role but does have effects on the body when ingested Lithium carbonate is used as a mood stabiliser in psychiatry to treat bipolar disorder in daily doses of about to grams although there are Excessive ingestion of lithium causes drowsiness slurred speech and vomiting among other symptoms and poisons the central nervous system which is dangerous as the required dosage of lithium to treat bipolar disorder is only slightly lower than the toxic dosage Its biochemistry the way it is handled by the human body and studies using rats and goats suggest that it is an essential trace element although the natural biological function of lithium in humans has yet to be identified Sodium and potassium occur in all known biological systems generally functioning as electrolytes inside and outside cells Sodium is an essential nutrient that regulates blood volume blood pressure osmotic equilibrium and pH the minimum physiological requirement for sodium is milligrams per day Sodium chloride also known as common salt is the principal source of sodium in the diet and is used as seasoning and preservative such as for pickling and jerky most of it comes from processed foods The DRI for sodium is grams per day but most people in the United States consume more than grams per day the minimum amount that promotes hypertension this in turn causes million premature deaths worldwide Potassium is the major cation positive ion inside animal cells while sodium is the major cation outside animal cells The concentration differences of these charged particles causes a difference in electric potential between the inside and outside of cells known as the membrane potential The balance between potassium and sodium is maintained by ion pumps in the cell membrane The cell membrane potential created by potassium and sodium ions allows the cell to generate an action potential a spike of electrical discharge The ability of cells to produce electrical discharge is critical for body functions such as neurotransmission muscle contraction and heart function Rubidium has no known biological role but may help stimulate metabolism and similarly to caesium replace potassium in the body causing potassium deficiency Caesium compounds are rarely encountered by most people but most caesium compounds are mildly toxic because of chemical similarity of caesium to potassium allowing the caesium to replace the potassium in the body causing potassium deficiency Exposure to large amounts of caesium compounds can cause hyperirritability and spasms but as such amounts would not ordinarily be encountered in natural sources caesium is not a major chemical environmental pollutant The median lethal dose value for caesium chloride in mice is g per kilogram which is comparable to the values of potassium chloride and sodium chloride Caesium chloride has been promoted as an alternative cancer therapy but has been linked to the deaths of over patients on whom it was used as part of a scientifically unvalidated cancer treatment Radioisotopes of caesium require special precautions the improper handling of gamma ray sources can lead to release of this radioisotope and radiation injuries Perhaps the case is the Goi nia accident of in which an radiation therapy system from an abandoned clinic in the city of Goi nia Brazil was scavenged from a junkyard and the glowing caesium salt sold to curious uneducated buyers This led to four deaths and serious injuries from radiation exposure Together with and was among the isotopes distributed by the Chernobyl disaster which constitute the greatest risk to health Francium has no biological role and is most likely to be toxic due to its extreme radioactivity causing radiation poisoning but since the greatest quantity of francium ever assembled to date is about neutral atoms it is unlikely that most people will ever encounter francium
