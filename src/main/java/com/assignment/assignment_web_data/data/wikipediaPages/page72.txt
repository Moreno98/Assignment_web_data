Asia Asia or is the Earth largest and most populous continent located primarily in the eastern and northern hemispheres Though it covers only of the Earth total surface area it comprises of earth land area and has historically been home to the bulk of the planet human population currently roughly Asia is notable for not only overall large size and population but unusually dense and large settlements as well as vast barely populated regions within the continent of billion people Asia has exhibited economic dynamism particularly East Asia as well as robust population growth during the century but overall population growth has since fallen to world average levels The boundaries of Asia are culturally determined as there is no clear geographical separation between it and Europe which together form one continuous landmass called Eurasia The most commonly accepted boundaries place Asia to the east of the Suez Canal the Ural River and the Ural Mountains and south of the Caucasus Mountains or the Kuma Manych Depression and the Caspian and Black Seas It is bounded on the east by the Pacific Ocean on the south by the Indian Ocean and on the north by the Arctic Ocean Given its size and diversity the concept of Asia a name dating back to classical antiquity may actually have more to do with human geography than physical geography Asia varies greatly across and within its regions with regard to ethnic groups cultures environments economics historical ties and government systems Definition and boundaries Greek system The border between Asia and Europe has historically been determined by Europeans only The original distinction between the two was made by the ancient Greeks They used the Aegean Sea the Dardanelles the Sea of Marmara the Bosporus the Black Sea the Kerch Strait and the Sea of Azov as the border between Asia and Europe The Nile was often used as the border between Asia and Africa then called Libya although some Greek geographers suggested the Red Sea would form a better boundary Darius canal between the Nile and the Red Sea introduced considerable variation in opinion Under the Roman Empire the Don River emptying into the Black Sea was the western border of Asia It was the northernmost navigable point of the European shore In the century the Red Sea became established as the boundary between Africa and Asia replacing the Nile Asia Europe boundary The Don River became unsatisfactory to northern Europeans when Peter the Great king of the Tsardom of Russia defeating rival claims of Sweden and the Ottoman Empire to the eastern lands and armed resistance by the tribes of Siberia synthesized a new Russian Empire extending to the Ural Mountains and beyond founded in The major geographical theorist of the empire was actually a former Swedish taken at the Battle of Poltava in and assigned to Tobolsk where he associated with Peter Siberian official Vasily Tatishchev and was allowed freedom to conduct geographical and anthropological studies in preparation for a future book In Sweden five years after Peter death in Philip Johan von Strahlenberg published a new atlas proposing the Urals as the border of Asia The Russians were enthusiastic about the concept which allowed them to keep their European identity in geography Tatishchev announced that he had proposed the idea to von Strahlenberg The latter had suggested the Emba River as the lower boundary Over the next century various proposals were made until the Ural River prevailed in the century The border had been moved perforce from the Black Sea to the Caspian Sea into which the Ural River projects In the maps of the period Transcaucasia was counted as Asian The incorporation of most of that region into the Soviet Union tended to push views of the border to the south Asian cultures had no say in this system of determining the imaginary boundaries separating them from Europe Asia Oceania boundary The border between Asia and the loosely defined region of Oceania is usually placed somewhere in the Malay Archipelago The terms Southeast Asia and Oceania devised in the century have had several vastly different geographic meanings since their inception The chief factor in determining which islands of the Malay Archipelago are Asian has been the location of the colonial possessions of the various empires there not all European Lewis and Wigen assert The narrowing of Southeast Asia to its present boundaries was thus a gradual process Ongoing definition Geographical Asia is a cultural artifact of European conceptions of the world being imposed onto other cultures an imprecise concept causing endemic contention about what it means Asia is larger and more culturally diverse than Europe It does not exactly correspond to the cultural borders of its various types of constituents From the time of Herodotus a minority of geographers have rejected the system Europe Africa Asia on the grounds that there is no or is no substantial physical separation between them For example Sir Barry Cunliffe the emeritus professor of European archeology at Oxford argues that Europe has been geographically and culturally merely the western excrescence of the continent of Asia Geographically Asia is the major eastern constituent of the continent of Eurasia with Europe being a northwestern peninsula of the landmass or of geologically Asia Europe and Africa make up a single continuous landmass except for the Suez Canal and share a common continental shelf Almost all of Europe and the better part of Asia sit atop the Eurasian Plate adjoined on the south by the Arabian and Indian Plate and with the easternmost part of Siberia east of the Chersky Range on the North American Plate Etymology The English word Asia was originally a concept of Greek civilization The place name Asia in various forms in a large number of modern languages is of unknown ultimate provenience Its etymology and language of origin are uncertain It appears to be one of the most ancient of recorded names A number of theories have been published English Asia can be traced through the formation of English literature to Latin literature where it has the same form Asia Whether all uses and all forms of the name derive also from the Latin of the Roman Empire is much less certain Classical antiquity Latin Asia and Greek appear to be the same word Roman authors translated as Asia The Romans named a province Asia Roman province which roughly corresponds with Turkey There was an Asia Minor and an Asia Major located in Iraq As the earliest evidence of the name is Greek it is likely circumstantially that Asia came from but ancient transitions due to the lack of literary contexts are difficult to catch in the act The most likely vehicles were the ancient geographers and historians such as Herodotus who were all Greek Roman civilization Hellenized extensively Ancient Greek certainly evidences early and rich uses of the name The first continental use of Asia is attributed to Herodotus about BC not because he innovated it but because his Histories are the earliest surviving prose to describe it in any detail He defines it carefully mentioning the previous geographers whom he had read but whose works are now missing By it he means Anatolia and the Persian Empire in contrast to Greece and Egypt Herodotus comments that he is puzzled as to why three women names were given to a tract which is in reality one Europa Asia and Libya referring to Africa stating that most Greeks assumed that Asia was named after the wife of Prometheus Hesione but that the Lydians say it was named after Asies son of Cotys who passed the name on to a tribe at Sardis In Greek mythology Asia or Asie was the name of a Nymph or Titan goddess of Lydia Herodotus geographical puzzlement was perhaps only a form of disagreement as having read the earlier Greek poetry along with everyone else literate he would have known perfectly well why places received female names Athens Mycenae Thebes and many other locations in fact had them In ancient Greek religion places were under the care of female divinities parallel to guardian angels The poets detailed their doings and generations in allegoric language salted with entertaining stories which subsequently playwrights transformed into classical Greek drama and became Greek mythology For example Hesiod mentions the daughters of Tethys and Ocean among whom are a holy company who with the Lord Apollo and the Rivers have youths in their keeping Many of these are geographic Doris Rhodea Europa Asia Hesiod explains For there are daughters of Ocean who are dispersed far and wide and in every place alike serve the earth and the deep waters The Iliad attributed by the ancient Greeks to Homer mentions two Phrygians the tribe that replaced the Luvians in Lydia in the Trojan War named Asios an adjective meaning Asian and also a marsh or lowland containing a marsh in Lydia as Bronze Age Before Greek poetry the Aegean Sea area was in a Greek Dark Age at the beginning of which syllabic writing was lost and alphabetic writing had not begun Prior to then in the Bronze Age the records of the Assyrian Empire the Hittite Empire and the various Mycenaean states of Greece mention a region undoubtedly Asia certainly in Anatolia including if not identical to Lydia These records are administrative and do not include poetry The Mycenaean states were destroyed about BC by unknown agents although one school of thought assigns the Dorian invasion to this time The burning of the palaces baked clay diurnal administrative records written in a Greek syllabic script called Linear B deciphered by a number of interested parties most notably by a young World War II cryptographer Michael Ventris subsequently assisted by the scholar John Chadwick A major cache discovered by Carl Blegen at the site of ancient Pylos included hundreds of male and female names formed by different methods Some of these are of women held in servitude as study of the society implied by the content reveals They were used in trades such as and usually came with children The epithet lawiaiai captives associated with some of them identifies their origin Some are ethnic names One in particular aswiai identifies women of Asia Perhaps they were captured in Asia but some others Milatiai appear to have been of Miletus a Greek colony which would not have been raided for slaves by Greeks Chadwick suggests that the names record the locations where these foreign women were purchased The name is also in the singular Aswia which refers both to the name of a country and to a female of it There is a masculine form aswios This Aswia appears to have been a remnant of a region known to the Hittites as Assuwa centered on Lydia or Roman Asia This name Assuwa has been suggested as the origin for the name of the continent Asia The Assuwa league was a confederation of states in western Anatolia defeated by the Hittites under Tudhaliya I around BC Alternatively the etymology of the term may be from the Akkadian word which means to go outside or to ascend referring to the direction of the sun at sunrise in the Middle East and also likely connected with the Phoenician word asa meaning east This may be contrasted to a similar etymology proposed for Europe as being from Akkadian er bu m to enter or set of the sun Reid supports this alternative etymology noting that the ancient Greek name must have derived from asu meaning east in Assyrian ereb for Europe meaning west The ideas of Occidental form Latin Occidens setting and Oriental from Latin Oriens for rising are also European invention synonymous with Western and Eastern Reid further emphasizes that it explains the Western point of view of placing all the peoples and cultures of Asia into a single classification almost as if there were a need for setting the distinction between Western and Eastern civilizations on the Eurasian continent Ogura Kazuo and Tenshin Okakura are two outspoken Japanese figures on the subject History The history of Asia can be seen as the distinct histories of several peripheral coastal regions East Asia South Asia Southeast Asia and the Middle East linked by the interior mass of the Central Asian steppes The coastal periphery was home to some of the world earliest known civilizations each of them developing around fertile river valleys The civilizations in Mesopotamia the Indus Valley and the Huanghe shared many similarities These civilizations may well have exchanged technologies and ideas such as mathematics and the wheel Other innovations such as writing seem to have been developed individually in each area Cities states and empires developed in these lowlands The central steppe region had long been inhabited by nomads who could reach all areas of Asia from the steppes The earliest postulated expansion out of the steppe is that of the who spread their languages into the Middle East South Asia and the borders of China where the Tocharians resided The northernmost part of Asia including much of Siberia was largely inaccessible to the steppe nomads owing to the dense forests climate and tundra These areas remained very sparsely populated The center and the peripheries were mostly kept separated by mountains and deserts The Caucasus and Himalaya mountains and the Karakum and Gobi deserts formed barriers that the steppe horsemen could cross only with difficulty While the urban city dwellers were more advanced technologically and socially in many cases they could do little in a military aspect to defend against the mounted hordes of the steppe However the lowlands did not have enough open grasslands to support a large horsebound force for this and other reasons the nomads who conquered states in China India and the Middle East often found themselves adapting to the local more affluent societies The Islamic Caliphate took over the Middle East and Central Asia during the Muslim conquests of the century The Mongol Empire conquered a large part of Asia in the century an area extending from China to Europe Before the Mongol invasion Song China reportedly had approximately million citizens the census which followed the invasion reported roughly million people The Black Death one of the most devastating pandemics in human history is thought to have originated in the arid plains of central Asia where it then travelled along the Silk Road The Russian Empire began to expand into Asia from the century and would eventually take control of all of Siberia and most of Central Asia by the end of the century The Ottoman Empire controlled Anatolia the Middle East North Africa and the Balkans from the century onwards In the century the Manchu conquered China and established the Qing Dynasty In the century the Islamic Mughal Empire controlled much of India Geography and climate Asia is the largest continent on Earth It covers of the Earth total surface area or of its land area and has the largest coastline at Asia is generally defined as comprising the eastern of Eurasia It is located to the east of the Suez Canal and the Ural Mountains and south of the Caucasus Mountains or the Kuma Manych Depression and the Caspian and Black Seas It is bounded on the east by the Pacific Ocean on the south by the Indian Ocean and on the north by the Arctic Ocean Asia is subdivided into countries two of them Russia and Turkey having part of their land in Europe Asia has extremely diverse climates and geographic features Climates range from arctic and subarctic in Siberia to tropical in southern India and Southeast Asia It is moist across southeast sections and dry across much of the interior Some of the largest daily temperature ranges on Earth occur in western sections of Asia The monsoon circulation dominates across southern and eastern sections due to the presence of the Himalayas forcing the formation of a thermal low which draws in moisture during the summer Southwestern sections of the continent are hot Siberia is one of the coldest places in the Northern Hemisphere and can act as a source of arctic air masses for North America The most active place on Earth for tropical cyclone activity lies northeast of the Philippines and south of Japan The Gobi Desert is in Mongolia and the Arabian Desert stretches across much of the Middle East The Yangtze River in China is the longest river in the continent The Himalayas between Nepal and China is the tallest mountain range in the world Tropical rainforests stretch across much of southern Asia and coniferous and deciduous forests lie farther north Climate change A survey carried out in by global risk analysis farm Maplecroft identified countries that are extremely vulnerable to climate change Each nation vulnerability was calculated using socio economic and environmental indicators which identified the likely climate change impacts during the next years The Asian countries of Bangladesh India Vietnam Thailand Pakistan and Sri Lanka were among the countries facing extreme risk from climate change Some shifts are already occurring For example in tropical parts of India with a climate the temperature increased by C between and A study by the International Crops Research Institute for the Tropics ICRISAT aimed to find approaches and techniques that would enable Asia agricultural systems to cope with climate change while benefitting poor and vulnerable farmers The study recommendations ranged from improving the use of climate information in local planning and strengthening services to stimulating diversification of rural household incomes and providing incentives to farmers to adopt natural resource conservation measures to enhance forest cover replenish groundwater and use renewable energy Economy Asia has the second largest nominal GDP of all continents after Europe but the largest when measured in purchasing power parity As of the largest economies in Asia are China Japan India South Korea and Indonesia Based on Global Office Locations Asia dominated the office locations with of top were in Asia Hong Kong Singapore Tokyo Seoul and Shanghai Around percent of international firms have office in Hong Kong In the late and early the economies of the PRC and India have been growing rapidly both with an average annual growth rate of more than Other recent very high growth nations in Asia include Israel Malaysia Indonesia Bangladesh Pakistan Thailand Vietnam Mongolia Uzbekistan Cyprus and the Philippines and nations such as Kazakhstan Turkmenistan Iran Brunei United Arab Emirates Qatar Kuwait Saudi Arabia Bahrain and Oman According to economic historian Angus Maddison in his book The World Economy A Millennial Perspective India had the world largest economy during BCE and BCE China was the largest and most advanced economy on earth for much of recorded history until the British Empire excluding India overtook it in the century For several decades in the late twentieth century Japan was the largest economy in Asia and of any single nation in the world after surpassing the Soviet Union measured in net material product in and Germany in NB A number of supernational economies are larger such as the European Union EU the North American Free Trade Agreement NAFTA or APEC This ended in when China overtook Japan to become the world second largest economy In the late and early Japan GDP was almost as large current exchange rate method as that of the rest of Asia combined In Japan economy nearly equaled that of the USA as the largest economy in the world for a day after the Japanese currency reached a record high of Economic growth in Asia since World War II to the had been concentrated in Japan as well as the four regions of South Korea Taiwan Hong Kong and Singapore located in the Pacific Rim known as the Asian tigers which have now all received developed country status having the highest GDP per capita in Asia It is forecasted that India will overtake Japan in terms of nominal GDP by By according to Goldman Sachs China will have the largest economy in the world Several trade blocs exist with the most developed being the Association of Southeast Asian Nations Asia is the largest continent in the world by a considerable margin and it is rich in natural resources such as petroleum forests fish water rice copper and silver Manufacturing in Asia has traditionally been strongest in East and Southeast Asia particularly in China Taiwan South Korea Japan India the Philippines and Singapore Japan and South Korea continue to dominate in the area of multinational corporations but increasingly the PRC and India are making significant inroads Many companies from Europe North America South Korea and Japan have operations in Asia developing countries to take advantage of its abundant supply of cheap labour and relatively developed infrastructure According to Citigroup of Global Growth Generators countries came from Asia driven by population and income growth They are Bangladesh China India Indonesia Iraq Mongolia Philippines Sri Lanka and Vietnam Asia has four main financial centers Tokyo Hong Kong Singapore and Shanghai Call centers and business process outsourcing BPOs are becoming major employers in India and the Philippines due to the availability of a large pool of highly skilled workers The increased use of outsourcing has assisted the rise of India and the China as financial centers Due to its large and extremely competitive information technology industry India has become a major hub for outsourcing In Asia had million millionaires people with net worth over million excluding their homes slightly below North America with million millionaires Last year Asia had toppled Europe Citigroup in The Wealth Report stated that Asian overtook North America wealth for the first time as the world economic center of gravity continued moving east At the end of there were Asian people mainly in Southeast Asia China and Japan who have at least million in disposable assets while North America with people and Western Europe with people Tourism With growing Regional Tourism with domination of Chinese visitors MasterCard has released Global Destination Cities Index with of are dominated by Asia and Pacific Region Cities and also for the first time a city of a country from Asia Bangkok set in the with international visitors Demographics East Asia had by far the strongest overall Human Development Index HDI improvement of any region in the world nearly doubling average HDI attainment over the past years according to the report s analysis of health education and income data China the second highest achiever in the world in terms of HDI improvement since is the only country on the Top Movers list due to income rather than health or education achievements Its per capita income increased a stunning over the last four decades also lifting hundreds of millions out of income poverty Yet it was not among the region s top performers in improving school enrolment and life expectancy Languages Asia is home to several language families and many language isolates Most Asian countries have more than one language that is natively spoken For instance according to Ethnologue more than languages are spoken in Indonesia more than languages spoken in India and more than are spoken in the Philippines China has many languages and dialects in different provinces Religions Many of the world major religions have their origins in Asia Asian mythology is complex and diverse The story of the Great Flood for example as presented to Christians in the Old Testament is first found in Mesopotamian mythology in the Epic of Gilgamesh Hindu mythology tells about an Avatar of the God Vishnu in the form of a fish who warned Manu of a terrible flood In ancient Chinese mythology Shan Hai Jing the Chinese ruler Da Yu had to spend years to control a deluge which swept out most of ancient China and was aided by the goddess N wa who literally fixed the broken sky through which huge rains were pouring Abrahamic The Abrahamic religions of Judaism Christianity Islam and Bah Faith originated in West Asia Judaism the oldest of the Abrahamic faiths is practiced primarily in Israel the birthplace and historical homeland of the Hebrew nation which today consists equally of those Israelites who remained in Africa and those who returned from diaspora in Europe North America and other regions though sizable communities continue to live abroad Christianity is also present throughout Asia In the Philippines and East Timor Roman Catholicism is the predominant religion it was introduced by the Spaniards and the Portuguese respectively In Armenia Cyprus Georgia and Asian Russia Eastern Orthodoxy is the predominant religion Various Christian denominations have adherents in portions of the Middle East as well as China and India Saint Thomas Christians in India trace their origins to the evangelistic activity of Thomas the Apostle in the century Islam which originated in Saudi Arabia is the largest and most widely spread religion in Asia With of the world Muslim population the country currently with the largest Muslim population in the world is Indonesia followed by Pakistan India Bangladesh Iran and Turkey Mecca Medina and to a lesser extent Jerusalem are the holiest cities for Islam in all the world These religious sites attract large numbers of devotees from all over the world particularly during the Hajj and Umrah seasons Iran is the largest country and Pakistan has the largest Ahmadiyya population The Bah Faith originated in Asia in Iran Persia and spread from there to the Ottoman Empire Central Asia India and Burma during the lifetime of Bah u h Since the middle of the century growth has particularly occurred in other Asian countries because Bah activities in many Muslim countries has been severely suppressed by authorities Lotus Temple is a big Temple in India Indian and East Asian religions Almost all Asian religions have philosophical character and Asian philosophical traditions cover a large spectrum of philosophical thoughts and writings Indian philosophy includes Hindu philosophy and Buddhist philosophy They include elements of nonmaterial pursuits whereas another school of thought from India C rv ka preached the enjoyment of the material world The religions of Hinduism Buddhism Jainism and Sikhism originated in India South Asia In East Asia particularly in China and Japan Confucianism Taoism and Zen Buddhism took shape As of Hinduism has around billion adherents The faith represents around of Asia population and is the second largest religion in Asia However it is mostly concentrated in South Asia Over of the populations of both India and Nepal adhere to Hinduism alongside significant communities in Bangladesh Pakistan Bhutan Sri Lanka and Bali Indonesia Many overseas Indians in countries such as Burma Singapore and Malaysia also adhere to Hinduism Buddhism has a great following in mainland Southeast Asia and East Asia Buddhism is the religion of the majority of the populations of Cambodia Thailand Burma Japan Bhutan Sri Lanka Laos and Mongolia Large Buddhist populations also exist in Singapore Taiwan South Korea Malaysia Nepal Vietnam China North Korea and small communities in India and Bangladesh In many Chinese communities Mahayana Buddhism is easily syncretized with Taoism thus exact religious statistics is difficult to obtain and may be understated or overstated The countries of China Vietnam and North Korea are officially atheist thus the number of Buddhists and other religious adherents may be Jainism is found mainly in India and in oversea Indian communities such as the United States and Malaysia Sikhism is found in Northern India and amongst overseas Indian communities in other parts of Asia especially Southeast Asia Confucianism is found predominantly in Mainland China South Korea Taiwan and in overseas Chinese populations Taoism is found mainly in Mainland China Taiwan Malaysia and Singapore Taoism is easily syncretized with Mahayana Buddhism for many Chinese thus exact religious statistics is difficult to obtain and may be understated or overstated Modern conflicts Some of the events pivotal in the Asia territory related to the relationship with the outside world in the World War were Culture Nobel prizes The polymath Rabindranath Tagore a Bengali poet dramatist
