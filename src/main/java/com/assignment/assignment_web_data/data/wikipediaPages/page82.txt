Economy of Angola The Economy of Angola is one of the economies in the world with the Economist asserting that for to Angolas Annual average GDP growth was percent It is still recovering from the Angolan Civil War that plagued Angola from independence in until Despite extensive oil and gas resources diamonds hydroelectric potential and rich agricultural land Angola remains poor and a third of the population relies on subsistence agriculture Since when the civil war ended the country has worked to repair and improve ravaged infrastructure and weakened political and social institutions High international oil prices and rising oil production have contributed to the very strong economic growth since but corruption and mismanagement remain particularly in the oil sector which accounts for over percent of GDP over percent of export revenue and over percent of government revenue History Portugal explorers and settlers founded trading posts and forts along the coast of Africa beginning in the century and reached the Angolan coast in the century Portuguese explorer Paulo Dias de Novais founded Luanda in as S o Paulo de Loanda and the region developed as a slave trade market with the help of local Imbangala and Mbundu peoples who were notable slave hunters Trade was mostly with the Portuguese colony of Brazil Brazilian ships were the most numerous in the ports of Luanda and Benguela By this time Angola a Portuguese colony was in fact like a colony of Brazil paradoxically another Portuguese colony A strong Brazilian influence was also exercised by the Jesuits in religion and education War gradually gave way to the philosophy of trade The great trade routes and the agreements that made them possible were the driving force for activities between the different areas warlike states become states ready to produce and to sell In the Planalto the high plains the most important states were those of Bi and Bailundo the latter being noted for its production of foodstuffs and rubber The colonial power Portugal becoming ever richer and more powerful would not tolerate the growth of these neighbouring states and subjugated them one by one so that by the beginning of this century the Portuguese had complete control over the entire area During the period of the Iberian Union Portugal lost influence and power and made new enemies The Dutch a major enemy of Castile invaded many Portuguese overseas possessions including Luanda After the lose of a naval Battel of Spain Portugal started an separatist war in and then the Dutch ruled Luanda from to as Fort Aardenburgh They were seeking black slaves for use in sugarcane plantations of Northeastern Brazil Pernambuco Olinda Recife which they had also seized from Portugal John Maurice Prince of conquered the Portuguese possessions of Saint George del Mina Saint Thomas and Luanda Angola on the west coast of Africa After the dissolution of the Iberian Union in Portugal would reestablish its authority over the lost territories of the Portuguese Empire The Portuguese started to develop townships trading posts logging camps and small processing factories From onwards there was a gradual change from a society to one based on production for domestic consumption and export Meanwhile with the independence of Brazil in the slave trade was abolished in and in Angola ports were opened to foreign shipping By Luanda was one of the greatest and most developed Portuguese cities in the vast Portuguese Empire outside Mainland Portugal full of trading companies exporting together with Benguela palm and peanut oil wax copal timber ivory cotton coffee and cocoa among many other products Maize tobacco dried meat and cassava flour also began to be produced locally The Angolan bourgeoisie was born From the to the strong economic growth abundant natural resources and development of infrastructure led to the arrival of even more Portuguese settlers The Portuguese discovered petroleum in Angola in Production began in the Cuanza basin in the in the Congo basin in the and in the exclave of Cabinda in The Portuguese government granted operating rights for Block Zero to the Cabinda Gulf Oil Company a subsidiary of ChevronTexaco in Oil production surpassed the exportation of coffee as Angola largest export in A leftist coup tat started on April in Lisbon overthrew the Marcelo Caetano government in Portugal and promised to hand over power to an independent Angolan government Mobutu Sese Seko the President of Zaire met with Ant nio de Sp nola the transitional President of Portugal on September on Sal island in Cape Verde crafting a plan to empower Holden Roberto of the National Liberation Front of Angola Jonas Savimbi of UNITA and Daniel Chipenda of the MPLA eastern faction at the expense of MPLA leader Agostinho Neto while retaining the fa ade of national unity Mobutu and Sp nola wanted to present Chipenda as the MPLA head Mobutu particularly preferring Chipenda over Neto because Chipenda supported autonomy for Cabinda The Angolan exclave has immense petroleum reserves estimated at around million tons kg which Zaire and thus the Mobutu government depended on for economic survival After independence thousands of white Portuguese left most of them to Portugal and many travelling overland to South Africa There was an immediate crisis because the indigenous African population lacked the skills and knowledge needed to run the country and maintain its infrastructure The Angolan government created Sonangol a oil company in Two years later Sonangol received the rights to oil exploration and production in all of Angola After independence from Portugal in Angola was ravaged by a horrific civil war between and United Nations Angola Verification Mission III and MONUA spent billion overseeing implementation of the Lusaka Protocol a peace accord that ultimately failed to end the civil war The protocol prohibited UNITA from buying foreign arms a provision the

construction industry is another sector taking advantage of the growing economy with various housing projects stimulated by the government that created various initiatives for this Examples are the program Angola Investe and the projects Casa Feliz or Me a However not all public construction projects are functional a case in point is Kilamba Kiaxi where a whole new satellite town of Luanda consisting in the main of housing facilities for several hundreds of thousands of people was completely inhibited for over four years because of the skyrocket prices but it completely sold out after the government decreased the original price and created mortgage plans at around the election time thus made it affordable for people ChevronTexaco started pumping from Block in January but production has decreased to in due to the poor quality of the oil Angola joined the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries on January Cabinda Gulf Oil Company found an oil reservoir in Block on August

development programs in building roads and other basic infrastructure for the nation In the last decade of the colonial period Angola was a major African food exporter but now imports almost all its food Because of severe wartime conditions including extensive planting of landmines throughout the countryside agricultural activities have been brought to a near standstill Some efforts to recover have gone forward however notably in fisheries Coffee production though a fraction of its level is sufficient for domestic needs and some exports In sharp contrast to a bleak picture of devastation and bare subsistence is expanding oil production now almost half of GDP and of exports at Diamonds provided much of the revenue for Jonas Savimbi UNITA rebellion through illicit trade Other rich
