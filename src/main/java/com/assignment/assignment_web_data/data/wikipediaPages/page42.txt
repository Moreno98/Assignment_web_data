Algae Algae or singular alga Latin for seaweed are a very large and diverse group of eukaryotic organisms ranging from unicellular genera such as Chlorella and the diatoms to multicellular forms such as the giant kelp a large brown alga that may grow up to meters in length Most are autotrophic and lack many of the distinct cell and tissue types found in land plants such as stomata xylem and phloem The largest and most complex marine algae are called seaweeds while the most complex freshwater forms are the Charophyta a division of algae that includes Spirogyra and the stoneworts There is no generally accepted definition of algae One definition is that algae have chlorophyll as their primary photosynthetic pigment and lack a sterile covering of cells around their reproductive cells Other authors exclude all prokaryotes and thus do not consider cyanobacteria algae as algae Algae constitute a polyphyletic group since they do not include a common ancestor and although their plastids seem to have a single origin from cyanobacteria they were acquired in different ways Green algae are examples of algae that have primary chloroplasts derived from endosymbiotic cyanobacteria Diatoms are examples of algae with secondary chloroplasts derived from an endosymbiotic red alga Algae exhibit a wide range of reproductive strategies from simple asexual cell division to complex forms of sexual reproduction Algae lack the various structures that characterize land plants such as the phyllids structures of bryophytes rhizoids in nonvascular plants and the roots leaves and other organs that are found in tracheophytes vascular plants Most are phototrophic although some groups contain members that are mixotrophic deriving energy both from photosynthesis and uptake of organic carbon either by osmotrophy myzotrophy or phagotrophy Some unicellular species such as the green algae Prototheca and Helicosporidium and many euglenids dinoflagellates and other algae have become heterotrophs also called colorless or apochlorotic algae sometimes parasitic relying entirely on external energy sources and have limited or no photosynthetic apparatus Some other heterotrophic organisms like the apicomplexans are also derived from cells whose ancestors possessed plastids but are not traditionally considered as algae Algae have photosynthetic machinery ultimately derived from cyanobacteria that produce oxygen as a of photosynthesis unlike other photosynthetic bacteria such as purple and green sulfur bacteria Fossilized filamentous algae from the Vindhya basin have been dated back to to billion years ago Etymology and study The singular alga is the Latin word for a particular seaweed and retains that meaning in English The etymology is obscure Although some speculate that it is related to Latin alg re be cold there is no known reason to associate seaweed with temperature A more likely source is alliga binding entwining The Ancient Greek word for seaweed was f kos or phykos which could mean either the seaweed probably red algae or a red dye derived from it The Latinization f cus meant primarily the cosmetic rouge The etymology is uncertain but a strong candidate has long been some word related to the Biblical p k paint if not that word itself a cosmetic used by the ancient Egyptians and other inhabitants of the eastern Mediterranean It could be any color black red green blue Accordingly the modern study of marine and freshwater algae is called either phycology or algology depending on whether the Greek or Latin root is used The name Fucus appears in a number of taxa Classification Most algae contain chloroplasts that are similar in structure to cyanobacteria Chloroplasts contain circular DNA like that in cyanobacteria and presumably represent reduced endosymbiotic cyanobacteria However the exact origin of the chloroplasts is different among separate lineages of algae reflecting their acquisition during different endosymbiotic events The table below describes the composition of the three major groups of algae Their lineage relationships are shown in the figure in the upper right Many of these groups contain some members that are no longer photosynthetic Some retain plastids but not chloroplasts while others have lost plastids entirely Phylogeny based on plastid not nucleocytoplasmic genealogy Linnaeus in Species Plantarum In Systema Naturae Linnaeus described the genera Volvox and Corallina among the animals In Samuel Gottlieb Gmelin published the Historia Fucorum the first work dedicated to marine algae and the first book on marine biology to use the then new binomial nomenclature of Linnaeus It included elaborate illustrations of seaweed and marine algae on folded leaves and Lamouroux were the first to divide macroscopic algae into four divisions based on their pigmentation This is the first use of a biochemical criterion in plant systematics Harvey four divisions are red algae Rhodospermae brown algae Melanospermae green algae Chlorospermae and Diatomaceae At this time microscopic algae were discovered and reported by a different group of workers M ller and Ehrenberg studying the Infusoria microscopic organisms Unlike macroalgae which were clearly viewed as plants microalgae were frequently considered animals because they are often motile Even the coccoid microalgae were sometimes merely seen as stages of the life cycle of plants macroalgae or animals Although used as a taxonomic category in some classifications Linnaeus de Jussieu Horaninow Agassiz Wilson Cassin in further classifications the algae are seen as an artificial polyphyletic group Relationship to higher plants The first plants on earth probably evolved from shallow freshwater charophyte algae much like Chara almost million years ago These probably had an isomorphic alternation of generations and were probably filamentous Fossils of isolated land plant spores suggest land plants may have been around as long as million years ago Morphology A range of algal morphologies are exhibited and convergence of features in unrelated groups is common The only groups to exhibit multicellular thalli are the reds and browns and some chlorophytes Apical growth is constrained to subsets of these groups the florideophyte reds various browns and the charophytes The form of charophytes is quite different from those of reds and browns because they have distinct nodes separated by internode stems whorls of branches reminiscent of the horsetails occur at the nodes Conceptacles are another polyphyletic trait they appear in the coralline algae and the Hildenbrandiales as well as the browns Most of the simpler algae are unicellular flagellates or amoeboids but colonial and forms have developed independently among several of the groups Some of the more common organizational levels more than one of which may occur in the life cycle of a species are In three lines even higher levels of organization have been reached with full tissue differentiation These are the brown algae some of which may reach m in length kelps the red algae and the green algae The most complex forms are found among the green algae see Charales and Charophyta in a lineage that eventually led to the higher land plants The point where these plants begin and algae stop is usually taken to be the presence of reproductive organs with protective cell layers a characteristic not found in the other alga groups Physiology Many algae particularly members of the Characeae have served as model experimental organisms to understand the mechanisms of the water permeability of membranes osmoregulation turgor regulation salt tolerance cytoplasmic streaming and the generation of action potentials Phytohormones are found not only in higher plants but in algae too Symbiotic algae Some species of algae form symbiotic relationships with other organisms In these symbioses the algae supply photosynthates organic substances to the host organism providing protection to the algal cells The host organism derives some or all of its energy requirements from the algae Examples are as follows Lichens Lichens are defined by the International Association for Lichenology to be an association of a fungus and a photosynthetic symbiont resulting in a stable vegetative body having a specific structure The fungi or mycobionts are mainly from the Ascomycota with a few from the Basidiomycota They are not found alone in nature but when they began to associate is not known One mycobiont associates with the same phycobiont species rarely two from the green algae except that alternatively the mycobiont may associate with a species of cyanobacteria hence photobiont is the more accurate term A photobiont may be associated with many different mycobionts or may live independently accordingly lichens are named and classified as fungal species The association is termed a morphogenesis because the lichen has a form and capabilities not possessed by the symbiont species alone they can be experimentally isolated It is possible that the photobiont triggers otherwise latent genes in the mycobiont Coral reefs Dinoflagellates algal protists are often endosymbionts in the cells of marine invertebrates where they accelerate metabolism by generating immediately available sugar and oxygen through photosynthesis using incident light and the carbon dioxide produced by the host Stony corals that are corals hermatypic corals require endosymbiotic algae from the genus Symbiodinium to be in a healthy condition The loss of Symbiodinium from the host is known as coral bleaching a condition which leads to the deterioration of a reef Sea sponges Green algae live close to the surface of some sponges for example breadcrumb sponge Halichondria panicea The alga is thus protected from predators the sponge is provided with oxygen and sugars which can account for to of sponge growth in some species Rhodophyta Chlorophyta and Heterokontophyta the three main algal phyla have which show tremendous variation with considerable complexity In general there is an asexual phase where the seaweed cells are diploid a sexual phase where the cells are haploid followed by fusion of the male and female gametes Asexual reproduction is advantageous in that it permits efficient population increases but less variation is possible Sexual reproduction allows more variation but is more costly Often there is no strict alternation between the sporophyte and also because there is often an asexual phase which could include the fragmentation of the thallus Numbers The Algal Collection of the US National Herbarium located in the National Museum of Natural History consists of approximately dried specimens which although not exhaustive no exhaustive collection exists gives an idea of the order of magnitude of the number of algal species that number remains unknown Estimates vary widely For example according to one standard textbook in the British Isles the UK Biodiversity Steering Group Report estimated there to be algal species in the UK Another checklist reports only about species Regarding the difference of about species the text concludes It will require many detailed field surveys before it is possible to provide a reliable estimate of the total number of species Regional and group estimates have been made as well and so on but lacking any scientific basis or reliable sources these numbers have no more credibility than the British ones mentioned above Most estimates also omit microscopic algae such as phytoplankton The most recent estimate suggests a total number of algal species worldwide Distribution The distribution of algal species has been fairly well studied since the founding of phytogeography in the century AD Algae spread mainly by the dispersal of spores analogously to the dispersal of Plantae by seeds and spores Spores are everywhere in all parts of the Earth the waters fresh and marine the atmosphere and in precipitation or mixed with dust the humus and in other organisms such as humans Whether a spore is to grow into an organism depends on the combination of the species and the environmental conditions of where the spore lands The spores of algae are dispersed mainly by running water and wind as well as by living carriers The bodies of water into which they are transported are chemically selective Marine spores are spread by currents Ocean water is temperature selective resulting in phytogeographic zones regions and provinces To some degree the distribution of algae is subject to floristic discontinuities caused by geographical features such as Antarctica long distances of ocean or general land masses It is therefore possible to identify species occurring by locality such as Pacific Algae or North Sea Algae When they occur out of their localities it is usually possible to hypothesize a transport mechanism such as the hulls of ships For example Ulva reticulata and Ulva fasciata travelled from the mainland to Hawaii in this manner Mapping is possible for select species only there are many valid examples of confined distribution patterns For example Clathromorphum is an arctic genus and is not mapped far south of there On the other hand scientists regard the overall data as insufficient due to the difficulties of undertaking such studies Locations Algae are prominent in bodies of water common in terrestrial environments and are found in unusual environments such as on snow and on ice Seaweeds grow mostly in shallow marine waters under however some have been recorded to a depth of The various sorts of algae play significant roles in aquatic ecology Microscopic forms that live suspended in the water column phytoplankton provide the food base for most marine food chains In very high densities algal blooms these algae may discolor the water and outcompete poison or asphyxiate other life forms Algae are variously sensitive to different factors which has made them useful as biological indicators in the Ballantine Scale and its modification Cultural associations In Classical Chinese the word is used both for algae and in the modest tradition of the imperial scholars for literary talent The third island in Kunming Lake beside the Summer Palace in Beijing is known as the Zaojian Tang Dao which thus simultaneously means Island of the Hall and Island of the Hall for Reflecting on Literary Talent Uses Agar Agar a gelatinous substance derived from red algae has a number of commercial uses It is a good medium on which to grow bacteria and fungi as most microorganisms can not digest agar Alginates Alginic acid or alginate is extracted from brown algae Its uses range from gelling agents in food to medical dressings Alginic acid also has been used in the field of biotechnology as a biocompatible medium for cell encapsulation and cell immobilization Molecular cuisine is also a user of the substance for its gelling properties by which it becomes a delivery vehicle for flavours Between and wet tons of Macrocystis are harvested annually in New Mexico for alginate extraction and abalone feed Energy source To be competitive and independent from fluctuating support from local policy on the long run biofuels should equal or beat the cost level of fossil fuels Here algae based fuels hold great promise directly related to the potential to produce more biomass per unit area in a year than any other form of biomass The point for biofuels is estimated to occur by Fertilizer For centuries seaweed has been used as a fertilizer George Owen of Henllys writing in the century referring to drift weed in South Wales This kind of ore they often gather and lay on great heapes where it heteth and rotteth and will have a strong and loathsome smell when being so rotten they cast on the land as they do their muck and thereof springeth good corn especially barley After or great rigs of the sea they fetch it in sacks on horse backes and carie the same three four or five miles and cast it on the lande which doth very much better the ground for corn and grass Today algae are used by humans in many ways for example as fertilizers soil conditioners and livestock feed Aquatic and microscopic species are cultured in clear tanks or ponds and are either harvested or used to treat effluents pumped through the ponds Algaculture on a large scale is an important type of aquaculture in some places Maerl is commonly used as a soil conditioner Nutrition Naturally growing seaweeds are an important source of food especially in Asia They provide many vitamins including A niacin and C and are rich in iodine potassium iron magnesium and calcium In addition commercially cultivated microalgae including both algae and cyanobacteria are marketed as nutritional supplements such as Spirulina Chlorella and the supplement Dunaliella high in Algae are national foods of many nations China consumes more than species including fat choy a cyanobacterium considered a vegetable Japan over species Ireland dulse Chile cochayuyo Laver is used to make laver bread in Wales where it is known as bara lawr in Korea gim in Japan nori and aonori It is also used along the west coast of North America from California to British Columbia in Hawaii and by the M ori of New Zealand Sea lettuce and badderlocks are a salad ingredient in Scotland Ireland Greenland and Iceland The oils from some algae have high levels of unsaturated fatty acids For example Parietochloris incisa is very high in arachidonic acid where it reaches up to of the triglyceride pool Some varieties of algae favored by vegetarianism and veganism contain the essential fatty acids Docosahexaenoic acid DHA and Eicosapentaenoic acid EPA Fish oil contains the fatty acids but the original source is algae microalgae in particular which are eaten by marine life such as copepods and are passed up the food chain Algae has emerged in recent years as a popular source of fatty acids for vegetarians who can not get EPA and DHA from other vegetarian sources such as flaxseed oil which only contains the acid ALA Pollution control Agricultural Research Service scientists found that of nitrogen runoff and of phosphorus runoff can be captured from manure effluents using a horizontal algae scrubber also called an algal turf scrubber ATS Scientists developed the ATS which are shallow raceways of nylon netting where algae colonies can form and studied its efficacy for three years They found that algae can readily be used to reduce the nutrient runoff from agricultural fields and increase the quality of water flowing into rivers streams and oceans The enriched algae itself also can be used as a fertilizer Researchers collected and dried the algae from the ATS and studied its potential as an organic fertilizer They found that cucumber and corn seedlings grew just as well using ATS organic fertilizer as they did with commercial fertilizers Algae scrubbers using bubbling upflow or vertical waterfall versions are now also being used to filter aquariums and ponds Bioremediation The algae Stichococcus bacillaris has been seen to colonize silicone resins used at archaeological sites biodeterriorating the synthetic substance Pigments The natural pigments carotenoids and chlorophylls produced by algae can be used as an alternative to chemical dyes and coloring agents Presence of some individual alga pigments together with specific pigment concentrations ratios are analysis of their concentrations with various analytical methods particularly HPLC can therefore offer deep insight into the taxonomic composition and relative abundance of natural alga populations in sea water samples Stabilizing substances Carrageenan from the red alga Chondrus crispus is used as a stabilizer in milk products
