Android robot An android is a robot or synthetic organism designed to look and act like a human especially one with a body having a resemblance Until recently androids have largely remained within the domain of science fiction frequently seen in film and television However advancements in robot technology have allowed the design of functional and realistic humanoid robots Etymology The word was coined from the Greek root man male as opposed to anthrop human being and the suffix having the form or likeness of The Oxford English Dictionary traces the earliest use as Androides to Ephraim Chambers Cyclopaedia in reference to an automaton that Albertus Magnus allegedly created The term android appears in US patents as early as in reference to miniature toy automatons The term android was used in a more modern sense by the French author Auguste Villiers de in his work Tomorrow Eve This story features an artificial humanlike robot named Hadaly As said by the officer in the story In this age of Realien advancement who knows what goes on in the mind of those responsible for these mechanical dolls The term made an impact into English pulp science fiction starting from Jack Williamson The Cometeers and the distinction between mechanical robots and fleshy androids was popularized by Edmond Hamilton Captain Future Although Karel apek robots in Rossum Universal Robots the play that introduced the word robot to the world were organic artificial humans the word robot has come to primarily refer to mechanical humans animals and other beings The term android can mean either one of these while a cyborg cybernetic organism or bionic man would be a creature that is a combination of organic and mechanical parts The term droid popularized by George Lucas in the original film and now used widely within science fiction originated as an abridgment of android but has been used by Lucas and others to mean any robot including distinctly form machines like The word android was used in episode What Are Little Girls Made Of The abbreviation andy coined as a pejorative by writer Philip Dick in his novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep has seen some further usage such as within the TV series Total Recall Authors have used the term android in more diverse ways than robot or cyborg In some fictional works the difference between a robot and android is only their appearance with androids being made to look like humans on the outside but with internal mechanics In other stories authors have used the word android to mean a wholly organic yet artificial creation Other fictional depictions of androids fall somewhere in between Eric Wilson who defines androids as a synthetic human being distinguishes between three types of androids based on their body composition Although human morphology is not necessarily the ideal form for working robots the fascination in developing robots that can mimic it can be found historically in the assimilation of two concepts simulacra devices that exhibit likeness and automata devices that have independence Projects Several projects aiming to create androids that look and to a certain degree speak or act like a human being have been launched or are underway Japan The Intelligent Robotics Lab directed by Hiroshi Ishiguro at Osaka University and Kokoro have demonstrated the Actroid at Expo in Aichi Prefecture Japan and released the Telenoid in In Kokoro developed a new DER android The height of the human body part of is cm There are mobile points can not only change its expression but also move its hands and feet and twist its body The air servosystem which Kokoro developed originally is used for the actuator As a result of having an actuator controlled precisely with air pressure via a servosystem the movement is very fluid and there is very little noise realized a slimmer body than that of the former version by using a smaller cylinder Outwardly has a more beautiful proportion Compared to the previous model has thinner arms and a wider repertoire of expressions Once programmed it is able to choreograph its motions and gestures with its voice The Intelligent Mechatronics Lab directed by Hiroshi Kobayashi at the Tokyo University of Science has developed an android head called Saya which was exhibited at Robodex in Yokohama Japan There are several other initiatives around the world involving humanoid research and development at this time which will hopefully introduce a broader spectrum of realized technology in the near future Now Saya is working at the Science University of Tokyo as a guide The Waseda University Japan and NTT Docomo manufacturers have succeeded in creating a robot It is capable of changing its face At first the creators decided the positions of the necessary points to express the outline eyes nose and so on of a certain person The robot expresses its face by moving all points to the decided positions they say The first version of the robot was first developed back in After that a year later they made a couple of major improvements to the design The robot features an elastic mask made from the average head dummy It uses a driving system with a unit The robot can change its facial features by activating specific facial points on a mask with each point possessing three degrees of freedom This one has facial points for a total of degrees of freedom As for the materials they used the mask is fabricated with a highly elastic material called Septom with bits of steel wool mixed in for added strength Other technical features reveal a shaft driven behind the mask at the desired facial point driven by a DC motor with a simple pulley and a slide screw Apparently the researchers can also modify the shape of the mask based on actual human faces To copy a face they need only a scanner to determine the locations of an individual facial points After that they are then driven into position using a laptop and motor control boards In addition the researchers also mention that the shifting robot can even display an individual hair style and skin color if a photo of their face is projected onto the Mask Korea KITECH researched and developed an android interpersonal communications model capable of emulating human emotional expression via facial musculature and capable of rudimentary conversation having a vocabulary of around words She is tall and weighs matching the average figure of a Korean woman in her twenties name derives from the Biblical Eve plus the letter r for robot advanced computing processing power enables speech recognition and vocal synthesis at the same time processing lip synchronization and visual recognition by cameras with face recognition technology An independent microchip inside her artificial brain handles gesture expression body coordination and emotion expression Her whole body is made of highly advanced synthetic jelly silicon and with artificial joints in her face neck and lower body she is able to demonstrate realistic facial expressions and sing while simultaneously dancing In South Korea the Ministry of Information and Communication has an ambitious plan to put a robot in every household by Several robot cities have been planned for the country the first will be built in at a cost of billion won of which billion is direct government investment The new robot city will feature research and development centers for manufacturers and part suppliers as well as exhibition halls and a stadium for robot competitions The country new Robotics Ethics Charter will establish ground rules and laws for human interaction with robots in the future setting standards for robotics users and manufacturers as well as guidelines on ethical standards to be programmed into robots to prevent human abuse of robots and vice versa United States Walt Disney and a staff of Imagineers created Great Moments with Lincoln that debuted at the New York World Fair Hanson Robotics of Texas and KAIST produced an android portrait of Albert Einstein using Hanson facial android technology mounted on KAIST walking bipedal robot body This Einstein android also called Albert Hubo thus represents the first walking android in history see video at Hanson Robotics the FedEx Institute of Technology and the University of Texas at Arlington also developed the android portrait of author Philip Dick creator of Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep the basis for the film Blade Runner with full conversational capabilities that incorporated thousands of pages of the author works In the PKD android won a first place artificial intelligence award from AAAI United Kingdom In Steve Grand OBE creator of the computer game Creatures created an android or anthropoid he named it Lucy The intention was that she would have to learn everything including how to use her mechanical vocal chords to speak Her systems were made to be similar to a human Use in fiction Androids are a staple of science fiction Isaac Asimov pioneered the fictionalization of the science of robotics and artificial intelligence notably in his series I Robot and Foundation and Empire One thing common to most fictional androids is that the technological challenges associated with creating thoroughly robots such as the creation of strong artificial intelligence are assumed to have been solved Fictional androids are often depicted as mentally and physically equal or superior to humans moving thinking and speaking as fluidly as them The tension between the nonhuman substance and the human appearance or even human ambitions of androids is the dramatic impetus behind most of their fictional depictions Some android heroes seek like Pinocchio to become human as in the films Bicentennial Man Hollywood Enthiran and Artificial Intelligence or Data in Others as in the film Westworld rebel against abuse by careless humans Android hunter Deckard in Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep and its film adaptation Blade Runner discovers that his targets are in some ways more human than he is Android stories therefore are not essentially stories about androids they are stories about the human condition and what it means to be human One aspect of writing about the meaning of humanity is to use discrimination against androids as a mechanism for exploring racism in society as in Blade Runner Perhaps the clearest example of this is John Brunner novel Into the Slave Nebula where the android slaves are explicitly shown to be fully human More recently the androids Bishop and Annalee Call in the films Aliens and Alien Resurrection are used as vehicles for exploring how humans deal with the presence of an Other Female androids or gynoids are often seen in science fiction and can be viewed as a continuation of the long tradition of men attempting to create the stereotypical perfect woman Examples include the Greek myth of Pygmalion and the female robot Maria in Fritz Lang Metropolis Some gynoids like Pris in Blade Runner are designed as with the intent of pleasing men violent sexual desires or as submissive servile companions such as in The Stepford Wives Fiction about gynoids has therefore been described as reinforcing essentialist ideas of femininity although others have suggested that the treatment of androids is a way of exploring racism and misogyny in society
