Angola Angola officially the Republic of Angola Kikongo Kimbundu Umbundu Repubilika ya Ngola is a country in Southern Africa It is the seventh largest country in Africa and is bordered by Namibia on the south the Democratic Republic of the Congo on the north and Zambia on the east its west coast is on the Atlantic Ocean and Luanda is its capital city The exclave province of Cabinda has borders with the Republic of the Congo and the Democratic Republic of the Congo The Portuguese were present in some mostly coastal points of the territory of what is now Angola from the century interacting in diverse ways with the peoples who lived there In the century settlers slowly and hesitantly began to establish themselves in the interior Angola as a Portuguese colony encompassing the present territory was not established until the early century after the Mbunda resistance and abduction of their King Mwene Mbandu I Lyondthzi Kapova Independence was achieved in after a protracted liberation war After independence Angola descended into an intense civil war from to Despite the civil war areas such as Baixa de Cassanje continue a lineage of kings which have included the former King Kambamba Kulaxingo and current King Dianhenga Aspirante Mjinji Kulaxingo Angola has vast mineral and petroleum reserves and its economy has on average grown at a pace since the especially following the end of the civil war In spite of this standards of living remain low for the majority of the population and life expectancy and infant mortality rates in Angola are among the worst in the world Angola is considered to be economically disparate with the majority of the nation wealth concentrated in a disproportionately small sector of the population Angola is a member state of the United Nations OPEC African Union the Community of Portuguese Language Countries the Latin Union and the Southern African Development Community Etymology The name Angola comes from the Portuguese colonial name Reino de Angola Kingdom of Angola appearing as early as Dias de Novais charter The toponym was derived by the Portuguese from the title ngola held by the kings of Ndongo Ndongo was a kingdom in the highlands between the Kwanza and Lukala Rivers nominally tributary to the king of Kongo but which was seeking greater independence during the century History Early migrations and political units Khoisan are the earliest known modern human inhabitants of the area They were largely absorbed replaced by Bantu peoples during the Bantu migrations though small numbers remain in parts of southern Angola to the present day The Bantu came from the north probably from somewhere near the Republic of Cameroon and Sudan The establishment of the Bantu took many centuries and gave rise to various groups who took on different ethnic characteristics During this time the Bantu established a number of political units kingdoms empires in most parts of what today is Angola The best known of these is the Kingdom of the Kongo that had its centre in the northwest of contemporary Angola but included important regions in the west of present day Democratic Republic of the Congo and Republic of Congo and in southern Gabon It established trade routes with other trading cities and civilizations up and down the coast of southwestern and West Africa and even with the Great Zimbabwe Mutapa Empire but engaged in little or no transoceanic trade Others include the Mbunda whose Kingdom was established in the fifteenth century at the confluence of Kwilu and Kasai rivers in the south of present day Democratic Republic of the Congo after a misunderstanding in Kola also known as the origin of the Lunda and the Luba Kingdoms The Mbunda trace their origin from Sudan trekking southwards through Kola where they came in contact with the Luba and Ruund people They reached what is now Angola in the sixteenth century where they encountered the Khoisan Bushmen and other groups considerably less technologically advanced whom they easily dominated with their superior knowledge of ceramics and agriculture The Mbunda Kingdom in Mbundaland southeast of the now Angola endured until late nineteenth century one of the oldest and biggest ethnic grouping in Southern Africa Portuguese colonization The geographical areas now designated as Angola entered into contact with the Portuguese in the late century concretely in when Portugal established relations with the Kongo State which stretched from modern Gabon in the north to the Kwanza River in the south In this context the Portuguese established a small at the port of Mpinda in Soyo The Portuguese explorer Paulo Dias de Novais founded Luanda in as S o Paulo de Loanda with a hundred families of settlers and four hundred soldiers Benguela a Portuguese fort from which became a town in was another important early settlement they founded and ruled The Portuguese would establish several settlements forts and trading posts along the coastal strip of Angola which relied on the slave trade commerce in raw materials and the exchange of goods for survival The Atlantic slave trade provided a large number of black slaves to merchants and to slave dealers in Angola European traders would export manufactured goods to the coast of Africa where they would be exchanged for slaves Within the Portuguese Empire most black African slaves were traded to Portuguese merchants who bought them to sell as cheap labour for use on Brazilian agricultural plantations This trade would last until the first half of the century According to John Iliffe Portuguese records of Angola from the century show that a great famine occurred on average every seventy years accompanied by epidemic disease it might kill or of the population destroying the demographic growth of a generation and forcing colonists back into the river valleys The Portuguese gradually took control of the coastal strip during the century by a series of treaties and wars forming the Portuguese colony of Angola Taking advantage of the Portuguese Restoration War the Dutch occupied Luanda from to where they allied with local peoples consolidating their colonial rule against the remaining Portuguese resistance In a fleet under the command of Salvador de S retook Luanda for Portugal and initiated a conquest of the lost territories which restored Portugal to its former possessions by Treaties regulated relations with Kongo in and Njinga Kingdom of Matamba and Ndongo in The conquest of Pungo Andongo in was the last major Portuguese expansion from Luanda outwards as attempts to invade Kongo in and Matamba in failed Portugal also expanded its territory behind the colony of Benguela to some extent but until the century the inroads from Luanda and Benguela were very limited and Portugal had neither the intention nor the means to carry out a large scale territorial occupation and colonization The process resulted in few gains until the Development of the hinterland began after the Berlin Conference in fixed the colony borders and British and Portuguese investment fostered mining railways and agriculture based on various systems Full Portuguese administrative control of the hinterland did not establish itself until the beginning of the century after the Mbunda resistance and abduction of their King Mwene Mbandu I Lyondthzi Kapova eventually dislodged the Mbunda Kingdom extending Angolan territory over Mbundaland In the Portuguese government designated the colony as an overseas province of Portugal called the Overseas Province of Angola Portugal had a minimalist presence in Angola for nearly five hundred years and early calls for independence provoked little reaction amongst the population More overtly political organisations first appeared in the and began to make organised demands for especially in international forums such as the Movement The Portuguese regime meanwhile refused to accede to the demands for independence provoking an armed conflict that started in when black guerrillas attacked both white and black civilians in operations in northeastern Angola The war came to be known as the Colonial War In this struggle the principal protagonists included the People Movement for the Liberation of Angola MPLA founded in the National Front for the Liberation of Angola FNLA which appeared in and the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola UNITA founded in After many years of conflict that led to the weakening of all the insurgent parties Angola gained its independence on November after the coup tat in Lisbon Portugal which overthrew the Portuguese regime headed by Marcelo Caetano Portugal new revolutionary leaders began in a process of political change at home and accepted independence for its former colonies abroad In Angola a fight for dominance broke out immediately between the three nationalist movements The events prompted a mass exodus of Portuguese citizens creating up to destitute Portuguese refugees the retornados The new Portuguese government tried to mediate an understanding between the three competing movements and succeeded in getting them to agree on paper to form a common government But in the end none of the African parties respected the commitments made and military force resolved the issue Independence and civil war After it gained independence in November Angola experienced a devastating civil war which lasted several decades claimed millions of lives and produced many refugees Following negotiations held in Portugal itself experiencing severe social and political turmoil and uncertainty due to the April revolution Angola three main guerrilla groups agreed to establish a transitional government in January Within two months however the FNLA MPLA and UNITA had started fighting each other and the country began splitting into zones controlled by rival armed political groups The superpowers quickly became involved in the conflict which became a flash point for the Cold War The United States Zaire today Democratic Republic of the Congo and South Africa supported the FNLA and UNITA The Soviet Union and Cuba supported the MPLA In the beginning of the Angolan Civil War most of the Portuguese who lived in Angola and who had accounted for the majority of the skilled work in the public administration agriculture industries and trade fled the country leaving its once prosperous and growing economy in a state of bankruptcy During most of this period the MPLA organised and maintained a socialist r gime Ceasefire with UNITA On March Jonas Savimbi the leader of UNITA was killed in combat with government troops A was reached by the two factions shortly afterwards UNITA gave up its armed wing and assumed the role of major opposition party although in the knowledge that in the present regime a legitimate democratic election was impossible Although the political situation of the country began to stabilize regular democratic processes were not established before the Elections in Angola in and and the adoption of a new Constitution of Angola in all of which strengthened the prevailing system MPLA head officials continue to be given senior positions in top level companies or other fields although a few outstanding UNITA figures are given some shares in the economic as well as in the military share Among Angola major problems are a serious humanitarian crisis a result of the prolonged war the abundance of minefields the continuation of the political and to a much lesser degree military activities in favour of the independence of the northern exclave of Cabinda carried out in the context of the protracted Cabinda Conflict by the Frente para a Liberta o do Enclave de Cabinda but most of all the dilapidation of the country rich mineral resources by the regime While most of the internally displaced have now settled around the capital in the Musseques the general situation for Angolans remains desperate Geography At Angola is the world largest country It is comparable in size to Mali or twice the size of France or Texas It lies mostly between latitudes and S and longitudes and Angola is bordered by Namibia to the south Zambia to the east the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the and the South Atlantic Ocean to the west The coastal exclave of Cabinda in the north borders the Republic of the Congo to the north and the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the south Angola capital Luanda lies on the Atlantic coast in the northwest of the country Climate Angola has three seasons a dry season which lasts from May to October a transitional season with some rain from November to January and a hot rainy season from February to April April is the wettest month Angola average temperature on the coast is in the winter and in the summer while the interior is generally hotter and dryer Politics Angola motto is Virtus Unita Fortior a Latin phrase meaning Virtue is stronger when united The executive branch of the government is composed of the President the and the Council of Ministers For decades political power has been concentrated in the Presidency Governors of the provinces are appointed by the president The Constitutional Law of establishes the broad outlines of government structure and delineates the rights and duties of citizens The legal system is based on Portuguese and customary law but is weak and fragmented and courts operate in only of more than municipalities A Supreme Court serves as the appellate tribunal a Constitutional Court with powers of judicial review has not been constituted until despite statutory authorization After the end of the Civil War the regime came under pressure from within as well as from the international environment to become more democratic and less authoritarian Its reaction was to operate a number of changes without substantially changing its character Angola is classified as not free by Freedom House in the Freedom in the World report The report noted that the August parliamentary elections in which the ruling Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola won more than of the vote suffered from serious flaws including outdated and inaccurate voter rolls Voter turnout dropped from in to Angola scored poorly on the Ibrahim Index of African Governance It was ranked out of African countries scoring particularly badly in the areas of Participation and Human Rights Sustainable Economic Opportunity and Human Development The Ibrahim Index uses a number of different variables to compile its list which reflects the state of governance in Africa The new constitution adopted in further sharpened the authoritarian character of the regime In the future there will be no presidential elections the president and the of the political party which comes out strongest in the parliamentary elections become automatically president and of Angola Through a variety of mechanisms the state president controls all the other organs of the state so that the principle of the division of power is not maintained As a consequence Angola has no longer a presidential system in the sense of the systems existing in the USA or in France In terms of the classifications used in constitutional law its regime is considered one of several authoritarian regimes in Africa On October Angola was elected for the second time as member of the UN Security Council with favourable votes out of The mandate begins on January and lasts for two years Also in that month the country took on the leadership of the Group of African Ministers and Governors at the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank following the debates at the annual meetings of both entities Since January the Republic of Angola holds the presidency of the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region ICGLR In the executive secretary of ICGLR Ntumba Luaba said that Angola is the example to be followed by members of the organization because of the significant progress made over the years of peace particularly in terms of and stability Military The Angolan Armed Forces AAF is headed by a Chief of Staff who reports to the Minister of Defense There are three divisions the Army Ex rcito Navy Marinha de Guerra MGA and National Air Force For a A rea Nacional FAN Total manpower is about Its equipment includes fighters bombers and transport planes There are also Tucano for training role for training and bombing role Czech Zlin for training role and a variety of western made aircraft such as Aviocar Sud Aviation Alouette III A small number of AAF personnel are stationed in the Democratic Republic of the Congo Kinshasa and the Republic of the Congo Brazzaville Police The National Police departments are Public Order Criminal Investigation Traffic and Transport Investigation and Inspection of Economic Activities Taxation and Frontier Supervision Riot Police and the Rapid Intervention Police The National Police are in the process of standing up an air wing which will provide helicopter support for operations The National Police are developing their criminal investigation and forensic capabilities The force has an estimated patrol officers taxation and frontier supervision officers criminal investigators and financial crimes detectives and around economic activity inspectors The National Police have implemented a modernization and development plan to increase the capabilities and efficiency of the total force In addition to administrative reorganization modernization projects include procurement of new vehicles aircraft and equipment construction of new police stations and forensic laboratories restructured training programs and the replacement of AKM rifles with mm Uzis for officers in urban areas Justice In it is expected to enter into effect a new Penal Code in Angola The classification of the money laundering crime is one of the novelties in the new legislation Administrative divisions Angola is divided into eighteen provinces prov ncias and municipalities The municipalities are further divided into communes townships The provinces are Exclave of Cabinda With an area of approximately the Northern Angolan province of Cabinda is unusual in being separated from the rest of the country by a strip some wide of the Democratic Republic of Congo along the lower Congo river Cabinda borders the Congo Republic to the north and and the DRC to the east and south The town of Cabinda is the chief population center According to a census Cabinda had an estimated population of approximately of whom live in neighboring countries Population estimates are however highly unreliable Consisting largely of tropical forest Cabinda produces hardwoods coffee cocoa crude rubber and palm oil The product for which it is best known however is its oil which has given it the nickname the Kuwait of Africa Cabinda petroleum production from its considerable offshore reserves now accounts for more than half of Angola output Most of the oil along its coast was discovered under Portuguese rule by the Cabinda Gulf Oil Company CABGOC from onwards Ever since Portugal handed over sovereignty of its former overseas province of Angola to the local independence groups MPLA UNITA and FNLA the territory of Cabinda has been a focus of separatist guerrilla actions opposing the Government of Angola which has employed its military forces the FAA For as Armadas Angolanas and Cabindan separatists The Front for the Liberation of the Enclave of Forces of Cabinda announced a virtual Federal Republic of Cabinda under the Presidency of Henriques Tiago One of the characteristics of the Cabindan independence movement is its constant fragmentation into smaller and smaller factions Economy Angola financial system is maintained by the National Bank of Angola and managed by Governor Jose de Lima Massano Angola has a rich subsoil heritage from diamonds oil gold copper and a rich wildlife dramatically impoverished during the civil war forest and fossils Since independence oil and diamonds have been the most important economic resource Smallholder and plantation agriculture have dramatically dropped because of the Angolan Civil War but have begun to recover after The transformation industry that had come into existence in the late colonial period collapsed at independence because of the exodus of most of the ethnic Portuguese population but has begun to reemerge with updated technologies partly because of the influx of new Portuguese entrepreneurs Similar developments can be verified in the service sector Overall Angola economy has undergone a period of transformation in recent years moving from the disarray caused by a quarter century of civil war to being the fastest growing economy in Africa and one of the fastest in the world with an average GDP growth of percent between and In the period Angola had the world highest annual average GDP growth at percent In China Eximbank approved a billion line of credit to Angola The loan is being used to rebuild Angola infrastructure and has also limited the influence of the International Monetary Fund in the country China is Angola biggest trade partner and export destination as well as the importer Bilateral trade reached billion in up percent China imports mainly crude oil and diamonds increased percent to billion while China exports including mechanical and electrical products machinery parts and construction materials surged percent The overabundance of oil led to a local unleaded gasoline pricetag of per gallon The Economist reported in that diamonds and oil make up percent of Angola economy almost all of the country revenue and are its dominant exports Growth is almost entirely driven by rising oil production which surpassed in late and was expected to grow to by Control of the oil industry is consolidated in Sonangol Group a conglomerate which is owned by the Angolan government In December Angola was admitted as a member of OPEC However operations in diamond mines include partnerships between Endiama and mining companies such as ALROSA which continue operations in Angola The economy grew in in and in However due to the global recession the economy contracted an estimated in The security brought about by the peace settlement has led to the resettlement of million displaced persons thus resulting in increases in agriculture production Although the country economy has developed significantly since achieving political stability in mainly thanks to the earnings of the oil sector Angola faces huge social and economic problems These are in part a result of the almost continual state of conflict from onwards although the highest level of destruction and damage took place after the independence during the long years of civil war However high poverty rates and blatant social inequality are chiefly the outcome of a combination of a persistent political authoritarianism of practices at all levels of the political administrative military and economic apparatuses and of a pervasive corruption The main beneficiary of this situation is a social segment constituted since but mainly during the last decades around the political administrative economic and military power holders which has accumulated and continues accumulating enormous wealth Secondary beneficiaries are the middle strata which are about to become social classes However overall almost half the population has to be considered as poor but in this respect there are dramatic differences between the countryside and the cities where by now slightly more than of the people live An inquiry carried out in by the Angolan Instituto Nacional de Estat stica has it that in the rural areas roughly must be classified as poor according to UN norms but in the urban areas only while the overall rate is In the cities a majority of families well beyond those officially classified as poor have to adopt a variety of survival strategies At the same time in urban areas social inequality is most evident and assumes extreme forms in the capital Luanda In the Human Development Index Angola constantly ranks in the bottom group According to The Heritage Foundation a conservative American think tank oil production from Angola has increased so significantly that Angola now is China biggest supplier of oil Growing oil revenues have also created opportunities for corruption according to a recent Human Rights Watch report billion US dollars disappeared from government accounts from to Before independence in Angola was a breadbasket of southern Africa and a major exporter of bananas coffee and sisal but three decades of civil war destroyed the fertile countryside leaving it littered with landmines and driving millions into the cities The country now depends on expensive food imports mainly from South Africa and Portugal while more than percent of farming is done at family and subsistence level Thousands of Angolan farmers are trapped in poverty The enormous differences between the regions pose a serious structural problem in the Angolan economy This is best illustrated by the fact that about one third of the economic activities is concentrated in Luanda and the neighbouring Bengo province while several areas of the interior are characterized by stagnation and even regression One of the economic consequences of the social and regional disparities is a sharp increase in Angolan private investments abroad The small fringe of Angolan society where most of the accumulation takes place seeks to spread its assets for reasons of security and profit For the time being the biggest share of these investments is concentrated in Portugal where the Angolan presence including that of the family of the state president in banks as well as in the domains of energy telecommunications and mass media has become notable as has the acquisition of vineyards and orchards as well as of touristic enterprises With a stock of assets corresponding to billion USD billion Kz Angola is now the third largest financial market in Africa surpassed only by Nigeria and South Africa According to the Angolan Minister of Economy Abra o Gourgel the financial market of the country grew modestly from and now lies in third place at the level of Africa Angola s economy is expected to grow by percent in said the International Monetary Fund IMF According to the Fund robust growth in the nonoil economy mainly driven by a very good performance in the agricultural sector is expected to offset a temporary drop in oil production According to a study on the banking sector carried out by Deloitte the monetary policy led by Banco Nacional de Angola BNA the Angolan national bank allowed a decrease in the inflation rate put at in December which contributed to the sector s growth trend According to estimates divulged by Angola s central bank the country s economy should grow at an annual average rate of percent over the next four years boosted by the increasing participation of the private sector On December the Capital Market in Angola started BODIVA Angola Securities and Debt Stock Exchange in English received the secondary public debt market and it is expected to start the corporate debt market by but the stock market should only be a reality in Transport Transport in Angola consists of Travel on highways outside of towns and cities in Angola and in some cases within is often not best advised for those without vehicles While a reasonable road infrastructure has existed within Angola time and the war have taken their toll on the road surfaces leaving many severely potholed littered with broken asphalt In many areas drivers have established alternate tracks to avoid the worst parts of the surface although careful attention must be paid to the presence or absence of landmine warning markers by the side of the road The Angolan government has contracted the restoration of many of the country roads The road between Lubango and Namibe for example was completed recently with funding from the European Union and is comparable to many European main routes Progress to complete the road infrastructure is likely to take some decades but substantial efforts are already being made in the right directions Telecommunications The telecommunication industry is considered one of the main strategic sectors in Angola In October the building of the first optic fiber underwater cable in the Southern Hemisphere was announced The project aims to turn Angola into a continental hub thus improving Internet connections both nationally and internationally The first Angolan satellite will be ready for launch into orbit in and will ensure telecommunications throughout the country According to Aristides Safeca Secretary of State for Telecommunications the satellite will provide telecommunications services TV internet and and will remain into orbit at best for years Technology The management of the domain ao on web pages will go from Portugal to Angola in following the approval of a new legislation by the Angolan Government The joint decree of the minister of Telecommunications and Information Technologies Jos Carvalho da Rocha and the minister of Science and Technology Maria C ndida Pereira Teixeira states that under the massification of that Angolan domain conditions are created for the transfer of the domain root ao of Portugal to Angola Demographics Angola has a population of inhabitants according to the preliminary results of its census the first one conducted or carried out since December It is composed of Ovimbundu language Umbundu Ambundu language Kimbundu Bakongo and other ethnic groups including the Chokwe the Ovambo the Mbunda with the latter having been replaced by Ganguela a generic term for peoples east of the Central Highlands which has a slightly derogatory meaning when applied by the western ethnic groups and the Xindonga as well as about mesti os mixed European and African Chinese and European The Ambundu and Ovimbundu nations combined form a majority of the population at The population is forecast to grow to over million people to times the population It is estimated that Angola was host to refugees and asylum seekers by the end of of those refugees were originally from the Democratic Republic of Congo who arrived in the As of there were an estimated Democratic Republic of the Congo migrant workers at least Portuguese and about Chinese living in Angola Since more than Congolese migrants have been expelled from Angola Prior to independence in Angola had a community of approximately Portuguese but the vast majority left after independence and the ensuing civil war However Angola has recovered its Portuguese minority in recent years currently there are about registered with the consulates and increasing due to the debt crisis in Portugal and the relative prosperity in Angola The Chinese population stands at mostly composed of temporary migrants The total fertility rate of Angola is children born per woman estimates the highest in the world Languages The languages in Angola are those originally spoken by the different ethnic groups and Portuguese introduced during the Portuguese colonial era The indigenous languages with the largest usage are Umbundu Kimbundu and Kikongo in that order Portuguese is the official language of the country Mastery of the official language is probably more extended in Angola than it is elsewhere in Africa and this certainly applies to its use in everyday life Moreover and above all the proportion of native or near native speakers of the language of the former colonizer turned official after independence is no doubt considerably higher than in any other African country There are three intertwined historical reasons for this situation As a consequence of all this the African lower middle class which at that stage formed in Luanda and other cities began to often prevent their children from learning the local African language in order to guarantee that they learned Portuguese as their native language At the same time the white and mesti o population where some knowledge of African languages could previously often been found neglected this aspect more and more to the point of frequently ignoring it totally After independence these tendencies continued and were even strengthened under the rule of the MPLA which has its main social roots exactly in those social segments where the mastery of Portuguese as well as the proportion of native Portuguese speakers was highest This became a political side issue as FNLA and UNITA given their regional constituencies came out in favour of a greater attention to the African languages and as the FNLA favoured French over Portuguese The dynamics of the language situation as described above were additionally fostered by the massive migrations triggered by the Civil War Ovimbundu the most populous ethnic group and the most affected by the war appeared in great numbers in urban areas outside their areas especially in Luanda and surroundings At the same time a majority of the Bakongo who had fled to the Democratic Republic of Congo in the early or of their children and grandchildren returned to Angola but mostly did not settle in their original habitat but in the cities and again above all in Luanda As a consequence more than half the population is now living in the cities which from the linguistic point of view have become highly heterogeneous This means of course that Portuguese as the overall language of communication is by now of paramount importance and that the role of the African languages is steadily decreasing among the urban population a trend which is beginning to spread into rural areas as well The exact numbers of those fluent in Portuguese or who speak Portuguese as a first language are unknown although a census is expected to be carried out in July August Quite a number of voices demand the recognition of Angolan Portuguese as a specific variant comparable to those spoken in Portugal or in Brazil However while there exists a certain number of idiomatic particularities in everyday Portuguese as spoken by Angolans it remains to be seen whether or not the Angolan government comes to the conclusion that these particularities constitute a configuration that justifies the claim to be a new language variant Religion There are about mostly Christian religious communities in Angola While reliable statistics are nonexistent estimates have it that more than half of the population are Catholics while about a quarter adhere to the Protestant churches introduced during the colonial period the Congregationalists mainly among the Ovimbundu of the Central Highlands and the coastal region to its West the Methodists concentrating on the Kimbundu speaking strip from Luanda to Malanje the Baptists almost exclusively among the Bakongo of the Northwest now massively present in Luanda as well and dispersed Adventists Reformed and Lutherans In Luanda and region there subsists a nucleus of the syncretic Tocoists and in the northwest a sprinkling of Kimbanguism can be found spreading from the Since independence hundreds of Pentecostal and similar communities have sprung up in the cities where by now about of the population is living several of these are of Brazilian origin The Department of State estimates the Muslim population at while the Islamic Community of Angola puts the figure closer to Muslims consist largely of migrants from West Africa and the Middle East especially Lebanon although some are local converts The Angolan government does not legally recognize any Muslim organizations and often shuts down mosques or prevents their construction In a study assessing nations levels of religious regulation and persecution with scores ranging from to where represented low levels of regulation or persecution Angola was scored on Government Regulation of Religion on Social Regulation of Religion on Government Favoritism of Religion and on Religious Persecution Foreign missionaries were very active prior to independence in although since the beginning of the fight in the Portuguese colonial authorities expelled a series of Protestant missionaries and closed mission stations based on the belief that the missionaries were inciting sentiments Missionaries have been able to return to the country since the early although security conditions due to the civil war have prevented them until from restoring many of their former inland mission stations The Catholic Church and some major Protestant denominations mostly keep to themselves in contrast to the New Churches which actively proselytize Catholics as well as some major Protestant denominations provide help for the poor in the form of crop seeds farm animals medical care and education Culture In Angola there is a Culture Ministry that is managed by Culture Minister Rosa Maria Martins da Cruz e Silva Portugal has been present in Angola for years occupied the territory in the and early century and ruled over it for about years As a consequence both countries share cultural aspects language Portuguese and main religion Roman Catholic Christianity The substrate of Angolan culture is African mostly Bantu while Portuguese culture has been imported The diverse ethnic communities the Ovimbundu Ambundu Bakongo Chokwe Mbunda and other peoples maintain to varying degrees their own cultural traits traditions and languages but in the cities where slightly more than half of the population now lives a mixed culture has been emerging since colonial times in Luanda since its foundation in the century In this urban culture the Portuguese heritage has become more and more dominant An African influence is evident in music and dance and is moulding the way in which Portuguese is spoken but is almost disappearing from the vocabulary This process is well reflected in contemporary Angolan literature especially in the works of Pepetela and Ana Paula Ribeiro Tavares Leila Lopes Miss Angola was crowned Miss Universe in Brazil on September making her the first Angolan to win the pageant In Angola resume the National Festival of Angolan Culture FENACULT after a break The festival took place in all the provincial capitals of the country between August and September and had as theme Culture as a Factor of Peace and Development Health Epidemics of cholera malaria rabies and African hemorrhagic fevers like Marburg hemorrhagic fever are common diseases in several parts of the country Many regions in this country have high incidence rates of tuberculosis and high HIV prevalence rates Dengue filariasis leishmaniasis and onchocerciasis river blindness are other diseases carried by insects that also occur in the region Angola has one of the highest infant mortality rates in the world and one of the world lowest life expectancies A survey concluded that low and deficient niacin status was common in Angola Demographic and Health Surveys is currently conducting several surveys in Angola on malaria domestic violence and more In Angola launched a national campaign of vaccination against measles extended to every child under ten years old and aiming to go to all provinces in the country The measure is part of the Strategic Plan for the Elimination of Measles created by the Angolan Ministry of Health which includes strengthening routine immunization a proper dealing with measles cases national campaigns introducing a second dose of vaccination in the national routine vaccination calendar and active epidemiological surveillance for measles This campaign took place together with the vaccination against polio and vitamin A supplementation Education Although by law education in Angola is compulsory and free for eight years the government reports that a percentage of students are not attending due to a lack of school buildings and teachers Students are often responsible for paying additional expenses including fees for books and supplies In the gross primary enrollment rate was percent and in the most recent year for which data are available the net primary enrollment rate was percent Gross and net enrollment ratios are based on the number of students formally registered in primary school and therefore do not necessarily reflect actual school attendance There continue to be significant disparities in enrollment between rural and urban areas In percent of children ages to years were attending school It is reported that higher percentages of boys attend school than girls During the Angolan Civil War nearly half of all schools were reportedly looted and destroyed leading to current problems with overcrowding The Ministry of Education hired new teachers in and continued to implement teacher trainings Teachers tend to be underpaid inadequately trained and overworked sometimes teaching two or three shifts a day Some teachers may reportedly demand payment or bribes directly from their students Other factors such as the presence of landmines lack of resources and identity papers and poor health prevent children from regularly attending school Although budgetary allocations for education were increased in the education system in Angola continues to be extremely According to estimates by the UNESCO Institute for Statistics the adult literacy rate in was of males and of women are literate as of Since independence from Portugal in a number of Angolan students continued to be admitted every year at high schools polytechnical institutes and universities in Portugal Brazil and Cuba through bilateral agreements in general these students belong to the elites In September the Angolan Ministry of Education announced an investment of million Euros in the computerization of over classrooms across the country The project also includes training teachers at a national level as a way to introduce and use new information technologies in primary schools thus reflecting an improvement in the quality of teaching Sports Angola is the top basketball team of FIBA Africa and a regular competitor at the Summer Olympic Games and the FIBA World Cup The Angola national football team qualified for the FIFA World Cup as this was their first appearance on the World Cup finals stage They were eliminated after one defeat and two draws in the group stage They won COSAFA Cups and finished runner up in African Nations Championship Angola has participated in the World Women Handball Championship for several years The country has also appeared in the Summer Olympics for seven years and both compete and have hosted the FIRS Roller Hockey World Cup Angola is also often believed to have historic roots in the martial art Capoeira Angola and Batuque which were practiced by enslaved African Angolans transported as part of the Atlantic slave trade
