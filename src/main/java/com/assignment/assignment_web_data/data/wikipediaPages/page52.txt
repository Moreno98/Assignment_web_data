Acid An acid from the Latin re meaning sour is a chemical substance whose aqueous solutions are characterized by a sour taste the ability to turn blue litmus red and the ability to react with bases and certain metals like calcium to form salts Aqueous solutions of acids have a pH of less than A lower pH means a higher acidity and thus a higher concentration of positive hydrogen ions in the solution Chemicals or substances having the property of an acid are said to be acidic There are three common definitions for acids the Arrhenius definition the Br definition and the Lewis definition The Arrhenius definition defines acids as substances which increase the concentration of hydrogen ions H or more accurately hydronium ions when dissolved in water The Br definition is an expansion an acid is a substance which can act as a proton donor By this definition any compound which can easily be deprotonated can be considered an acid Examples include alcohols and amines which contain or fragments A Lewis acid is a substance that can accept a pair of electrons to form a covalent bond Examples of Lewis acids include all metal cations and molecules such as boron trifluoride and aluminium trichloride Common examples of acids include hydrochloric acid a solution of hydrogen chloride which is found in gastric acid in the stomach and activates digestive enzymes acetic acid vinegar is a dilute solution of this liquid sulfuric acid used in car batteries and tartaric acid a solid used in baking As these examples show acids can be solutions or pure substances and can be derived from solids liquids or gases Strong acids and some concentrated weak acids are corrosive but there are exceptions such as carboranes and boric acid Definitions and concepts Modern definitions are concerned with the fundamental chemical reactions common to all acids Most acids encountered in everyday life are aqueous solutions or can be dissolved in water so the Arrhenius and Br definitions are the most relevant The Br definition is the most widely used definition unless otherwise specified reactions are assumed to involve the transfer of a proton H from an acid to a base Hydronium ions are acids according to all three definitions Interestingly although alcohols and amines can be Br acids they can also function as Lewis bases due to the lone pairs of electrons on their oxygen and nitrogen atoms Arrhenius acids The Swedish chemist Svante Arrhenius attributed the properties of acidity to hydrogen ions H or protons in An Arrhenius acid is a substance that when added to water increases the concentration of H ions in the water Note that chemists often write H aq and refer to the hydrogen ion when describing reactions but the free hydrogen nucleus a proton does not exist alone in water it exists as the hydronium ion Thus an Arrhenius acid can also be described as a substance that increases the concentration of hydronium ions when added to water This definition stems from the equilibrium dissociation of water into hydronium and hydroxide OH ions In pure water the majority of molecules are but the molecules are constantly dissociating and and at any time a small number of the molecules always near in are hydronium and an equal number are hydroxide Because the numbers are equal pure water is neutral not acidic or basic An Arrhenius base on the other hand is a substance which increases the concentration of hydroxide ions when dissolved in water hence decreasing the concentration of hydronium The constant association and disassociation of molecules forms an equilibrium in which any increase in the concentration of hydronium is accompanied by a decrease in the concentration of hydroxide thus an Arrhenius acid could also be said to be one that decreases hydroxide concentration with an Arrhenius base increasing it In an acid the concentration of hydronium ions is greater than moles per liter Since pH is defined as the negative logarithm of the concentration of hydronium ions acids thus have a pH of less than Br acids While the Arrhenius concept is useful for describing many reactions it is also quite limited in its scope In chemists Johannes Nicolaus Br nsted and Thomas Martin Lowry independently recognized that reactions involve the transfer of a proton A Br acid or simply Br nsted acid is a species that donates a proton to a Br base Br theory has several advantages over Arrhenius theory Consider the following reactions of acetic acid the organic acid that gives vinegar its characteristic taste Both theories easily describe the first reaction acts as an Arrhenius acid because it acts as a source of when dissolved in water and it acts as a Br nsted acid by donating a proton to water In the second example undergoes the same transformation in this case donating a proton to ammonia but can not be described using the Arrhenius definition of an acid because the reaction does not produce hydronium Br theory can also be used to describe molecular compounds whereas Arrhenius acids must be ionic compounds Hydrogen chloride HCl and ammonia combine under several different conditions to form ammonium chloride In aqueous solution HCl behaves as hydrochloric acid and exists as hydronium and chloride ions The following reactions illustrate the limitations of Arrhenius definition As with the acetic acid reactions both definitions work for the first example where water is the solvent and hydronium ion is formed by the HCl solute The next two reactions do not involve the formation of ions but are still proton transfer reactions In the second reaction hydrogen chloride and ammonia dissolved in benzene react to form solid ammonium chloride in a benzene solvent and in the third gaseous HCl and combine to form the solid Lewis acids A third concept was proposed in by Gilbert Lewis which includes reactions with characteristics that do not involve a proton transfer A Lewis acid is a species that accepts a pair of electrons from another species in other words it is an electron pair acceptor Br nsted reactions are proton transfer reactions while Lewis reactions are electron pair transfers All Br nsted acids are also Lewis acids but not all Lewis acids are Br nsted acids Contrast how the following reactions are described in terms of chemistry In the first reaction a fluoride ion F gives up an electron pair to boron trifluoride to form the product tetrafluoroborate Fluoride loses a pair of valence electrons because the electrons shared in the B F bond are located in the region of space between the two atomic nuclei and are therefore more distant from the fluoride nucleus than they are in the lone fluoride ion is a Lewis acid because it accepts the electron pair from fluoride This reaction can not be described in terms of Br nsted theory because there is no proton transfer The second reaction can be described using either theory A proton is transferred from an unspecified Br nsted acid to ammonia a Br nsted base alternatively ammonia acts as a Lewis base and transfers a lone pair of electrons to form a bond with a hydrogen ion The species that gains the electron pair is the Lewis acid for example the oxygen atom in gains a pair of electrons when one of the H O bonds is broken and the electrons shared in the bond become localized on oxygen Depending on the context a Lewis acid may also be described as an oxidizer or an electrophile Dissociation and equilibrium Reactions of acids are often generalized in the form HA H A where HA represents the acid and A is the conjugate base conjugate pairs differ by one proton and can be interconverted by the addition or removal of a proton protonation and deprotonation respectively Note that the acid can be the charged species and the conjugate base can be neutral in which case the generalized reaction scheme could be written as HA H A In solution there exists an equilibrium between the acid and its conjugate base The equilibrium constant K is an expression of the equilibrium concentrations of the molecules or the ions in solution Brackets indicate concentration such that means the concentration of The acid dissociation constant K a is generally used in the context of reactions The numerical value of K a is equal to the product of the concentrations of the products divided by the concentration of the reactants where the reactant is the acid HA and the products are the conjugate base and H The stronger of two acids will have a higher K a than the weaker acid the ratio of hydrogen ions to acid will be higher for the stronger acid as the stronger acid has a greater tendency to lose its proton Because the range of possible values for K a spans many orders of magnitude a more manageable constant p K a is more frequently used where p K a K Stronger acids have a smaller p K a than weaker acids Experimentally determined p K a at C in aqueous solution are often quoted in textbooks and reference material Nomenclature In the classical naming system acids are named according to their anions That ionic suffix is dropped and replaced with a new suffix and sometimes prefix according to the table below For example HCl has chloride as its anion so the ide suffix makes it take the form hydrochloric acid In the IUPAC naming system aqueous is simply added to the name of the ionic compound Thus for hydrogen chloride the IUPAC name would be aqueous hydrogen chloride The prefix hydro is added only if the acid is made up of just hydrogen and one other element Classical naming system Acid strength The strength of an acid refers to its ability or tendency to lose a proton A strong acid is one that completely dissociates in water in other words one mole of a strong acid HA dissolves in water yielding one mole of H and one mole of the conjugate base A and none of the protonated acid HA In contrast a weak acid only partially dissociates and at equilibrium both the acid and the conjugate base are in solution Examples of strong acids are hydrochloric acid HCl hydroiodic acid HI hydrobromic acid HBr perchloric acid nitric acid and sulfuric acid In water each of these essentially ionizes The stronger an acid is the more easily it loses a proton H Two key factors that contribute to the ease of deprotonation are the polarity of the H A bond and the size of atom A which determines the strength of the H A bond Acid strengths are also often discussed in terms of the stability of the conjugate base Stronger acids have a larger K a and a more negative p K a than weaker acids Sulfonic acids which are organic oxyacids are a class of strong acids A common example is toluenesulfonic acid tosylic acid Unlike sulfuric acid itself sulfonic acids can be solids In fact polystyrene functionalized into polystyrene sulfonate is a solid strongly acidic plastic that is filterable Superacids are acids stronger than sulfuric acid Examples of superacids are fluoroantimonic acid magic acid and perchloric acid Superacids can permanently protonate water to give ionic crystalline hydronium salts They can also quantitatively stabilize carbocations While K a measures the strength of an acid compound the strength of an aqueous acid solution is measured by pH which is an indication of the concentration of hydronium in the solution The pH of a simple solution of an acid compound in water is determined by the dilution of the compound and the compound K Chemical characteristics Monoprotic acids Monoprotic acids are those acids that are able to donate one proton per molecule during the process of dissociation sometimes called ionization as shown below symbolized by HA Common examples of monoprotic acids in mineral acids include hydrochloric acid HCl and nitric acid On the other hand for organic acids the term mainly indicates the presence of one carboxylic acid group and sometimes these acids are known as monocarboxylic acid Examples in organic acids include formic acid HCOOH acetic acid and benzoic acid Polyprotic acids Polyprotic acids also known as polybasic acids are able to donate more than one proton per acid molecule in contrast to monoprotic acids that only donate one proton per molecule Specific types of polyprotic acids have more specific names such as diprotic acid two potential protons to donate and triprotic acid three potential protons to donate A diprotic acid here symbolized by can undergo one or two dissociations depending on the Each dissociation has its own dissociation constant and The first dissociation constant is typically greater than the second K K For example sulfuric acid can donate one proton to form the bisulfate anion for which K is very large then it can donate a second proton to form the sulfate anion wherein the K is intermediate strength The large K for the first dissociation makes sulfuric a strong acid In a similar manner the weak unstable carbonic acid can lose one proton to form bicarbonate anion and lose a second to form carbonate anion Both K a values are small but K K A triprotic acid can undergo one two or three dissociations and has three dissociation constants where K K K An inorganic example of a triprotic acid is orthophosphoric acid usually just called phosphoric acid All three protons can be successively lost to yield then and finally the orthophosphate ion usually just called phosphate Even though the positions of the three protons on the original phosphoric acid molecule are equivalent the successive K a values differ since it is energetically less favorable to lose a proton if the conjugate base is more negatively charged An organic example of a triprotic acid is citric acid which can successively lose three protons to finally form the citrate ion Although the subsequent loss of each hydrogen ion is less favorable all of the conjugate bases are present in solution The fractional concentration alpha for each species can be calculated For example a generic diprotic acid will generate species in solution HA and The fractional concentrations can be calculated as below when given either the pH which can be converted to the H or the concentrations of the acid with all its conjugate bases A plot of these fractional concentrations against pH for given K and K is known as a Bjerrum plot A pattern is observed in the above equations and can be expanded to the general n protic acid that has been deprotonated i times alpha H A i
