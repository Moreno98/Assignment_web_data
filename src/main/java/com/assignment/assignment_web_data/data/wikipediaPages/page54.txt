American National Standards Institute The American National Standards Institute ANSI is a private organization that oversees the development of voluntary consensus standards for products services processes systems and personnel in the United States The organization also coordinates standards with international standards so that American products can be used worldwide For example standards ensure that people who own cameras can find the film they need for that camera anywhere around the globe ANSI accredits standards that are developed by representatives of other standards organizations government agencies consumer groups companies and others These standards ensure that the characteristics and performance of products are consistent that people use the same definitions and terms and that products are tested the same way ANSI also accredits organizations that carry out product or personnel certification in accordance with requirements defined in international standards The organization headquarters are in Washington DC ANSI operations office is located in New York City The ANSI annual operating budget is funded by the sale of publications membership dues and fees accreditation services programs and international standards programs History ANSI was originally formed in when five engineering societies and three government agencies founded the American Engineering Standards Committee AESC In the AESC became the American Standards Association ASA In the ASA was reorganized and became the United States of America Standards Institute USASI The present name was adopted in Prior to these five founding engineering societies had been members of the United Engineering Society UES At the behest of the AIEE they invited the government Departments of War Navy combined in to become the Department of Defense or DOD and Commerce to join in founding a national standards organization According to Paul Agnew the first permanent secretary and head of staff in AESC started as an ambitious program and little else Staff for the first year consisted of one executive Clifford LePage who was on loan from a founding member ASME An annual budget of was provided by the founding bodies In the organization renamed ASA in became affiliated with the National Committee of the International Electrotechnical Commission IEC which had been formed in to develop electrical and electronics standards Members ANSI membership comprises government agencies organizations corporations academic and international bodies and individuals In total the Institute represents the interests of more than companies and million professionals Process Though ANSI itself does not develop standards the Institute oversees the development and use of standards by accrediting the procedures of standards developing organizations ANSI accreditation signifies that the procedures used by standards developing organizations meet the Institute requirements for openness balance consensus and due process ANSI also designates specific standards as American National Standards or ANS when the Institute determines that the standards were developed in an environment that is equitable accessible and responsive to the requirements of various stakeholders Voluntary consensus standards quicken the market acceptance of products while making clear how to improve the safety of those products for the protection of consumers There are approximately American National Standards that carry the ANSI designation The American National Standards process involves International activities In addition to facilitating the formation of standards in the ANSI promotes the use of standards internationally advocates policy and technical positions in international and regional standards organizations and encourages the adoption of international standards as national standards where appropriate The Institute is the official representative to the two major international standards organizations the International Organization for Standardization ISO as a founding member and the International Electrotechnical Commission IEC via the National Committee USNC ANSI participates in almost the entire technical program of both the ISO and the IEC and administers many key committees and subgroups In many instances standards are taken forward to ISO and IEC through ANSI or the USNC where they are adopted in whole or in part as international standards Standards panels The Institute administers nine standards panels Each of the panels works to identify coordinate and harmonize voluntary standards relevant to these areas In ANSI and the National Institute for Standards and Technology NIST formed the Nuclear Energy Standards Coordination Collaborative NESCC NESCC is a joint initiative to identify and respond to the current need for standards in the nuclear industry
