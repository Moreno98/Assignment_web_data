have also risen to power in Afghanistan such as the Kushans Hephthalites Kabul Shahis Saffarids Samanids Ghaznavids Ghurids Kartids Timurids Mughals and finally the Hotak and Durrani dynasties that marked the political origins of the modern state period Archaeological exploration done in the century suggests that the geographical area of Afghanistan has been closely connected by culture and trade with its neighbors to the east west and north Artifacts typical of the Paleolithic Mesolithic Neolithic Bronze and Iron ages have been found in Afghanistan Urban civilization is believed to have begun as early as BCE and the early city of Mundigak near Kandahar in the south of the country may have been a colony of the nearby Indus Valley Civilization After BCE successive waves of people from Central Asia began moving south into Afghanistan among them were many These tribes later migrated further south to India west to what is now Iran and towards Europe via the area north of the Caspian Sea The region as a whole was called Ariana The people shared similar culture with other The ancient religion of Kafiristan survived here until the century Another religion Zoroastrianism is believed by some to have originated in what is now Afghanistan between and BCE as its founder Zoroaster is thought to have lived and died in Balkh Ancient Eastern Iranian languages may have been spoken in the region around the time of the rise of Zoroastrianism By the middle of the century BCE the Achaemenid Persians overthrew the Medes and incorporated Arachosia Aria and Bactria within its eastern boundaries An inscription on the tombstone of King Darius I of Persia mentions the Kabul Valley in a list of the countries that he had conquered Alexander the Great and his Macedonian forces arrived to Afghanistan in BCE after defeating Darius III of Persia a year earlier in the Battle of Gaugamela Following Alexander brief occupation the successor state of the Seleucid Empire controlled the

vassals In the first century CE the vast Kushan Empire centered in modern Afghanistan became great patrons of Buddhist culture making Buddhism flourish throughout the region The Kushans were defeated by the Sassanids in the century CE Although the continued to rule at least parts of the region They were followed by the Kidarite Huns who in turn were replaced by the Hephthalites By the century CE the successors to the Kushans and Hepthalites established a small dynasty called Kabul Shahi Islamization and Mongol invasion Before the century the northwestern area of Afghanistan was referred to by the regional name Khorasan Two of the four capitals of Khorasan Herat and Balkh are now located in Afghanistan while the regions of Kandahar Zabulistan Ghazni Kabulistan and Afghanistan formed the frontier between Khorasan and Hindustan Arab Muslims brought Islam to Herat and Zaranj in CE and began spreading eastward some of the native inhabitants they encountered accepted it while others revolted The land was collectively recognized by the Arabs as due to its cultural connection with Greater India Before Islam was introduced people of the region were including Zoroastrians Buddhists Surya and Nana worshipers Jews and others The Zunbils and Kabul Shahi were first conquered in CE by the Saffarid Muslims of Zaranj Later the Samanids extended their Islamic influence south of the Hindu Kush It is reported that Muslims and still lived side by side in Kabul before the Ghaznavids rose to power in the century Afghanistan became one of the main centers in the Muslim world during the Islamic Golden Age By the century Mahmud of Ghazni defeated the remaining Hindu rulers and effectively Islamized the wider region with the exception of Kafiristan The Ghaznavid dynasty was defeated and replaced by the Ghurids who expanded and advanced the already powerful Islamic empire Some speculate that today Nasher clan is a remnant of the Ghaznavid dynasty In AD Genghis Khan and his Mongol army overran the region His troops are said to have annihilated the Khorasanian cities of Herat and Balkh as well as Bamyan The destruction caused by the Mongols forced many locals to return to an agrarian rural society Mongol rule continued with the Ilkhanate in the northwest while the Khilji dynasty administered the Afghan tribal areas south of the Hindu Kush until the invasion of Timur who established the Timurid dynasty in During the Ghaznavid Ghurid and Timurid eras the region produced many fine Islamic architectural monuments and numerous scientific and literary works In the early century Babur arrived from Fergana and captured Kabul from the Arghun dynasty From there he began dominating control of the central and eastern territories of Afghanistan He remained in Kabulistan until when he invaded Delhi in India to replace the Lodi dynasty with the Mughal Empire Between the and century the Khanate of Bukhara Safavids and Mughals ruled parts of the territory Hotak dynasty and Durrani Empire In Mirwais Hotak a Pashtun from Kandahar successfully rebelled against the Persian Safavids He overthrew and killed Gurgin Khan and made Afghanistan independent Mirwais died of a natural cause in and was succeeded by his brother Abdul Aziz who was soon killed by Mirwais son Mahmud for treason Mahmud led the Afghan army in to the Persian capital of Isfahan captured the city after the Battle of Gulnabad and proclaimed himself King of Persia The Persians rejected Mahmud and after the massacre of thousands of religious scholars nobles and members of the Safavid family the Hotak dynasty was ousted from Persia by Nader Shah Afshar after the Battle of Damghan In Nader Shah and his forces captured Kandahar the last Hotak stronghold from Shah Hussain Hotak at which point the incarcerated Ahmad Shah Durrani was freed and made the commander of an Afghan regiment Soon after the Persian and Afghan forces invaded India By the Afghans chose Durrani as their head of state Durrani and his Afghan army conquered much of Afghanistan Pakistan the Khorasan and Kohistan provinces of Iran and Delhi in India He defeated the Indian Maratha Empire and one of his biggest victories was the Battle of Panipat In October Durrani died of a natural cause and was buried at a site now adjacent to the Shrine of the Cloak in Kandahar He was succeeded by his son Timur Shah who transferred the capital of Afghanistan from Kandahar to Kabul in After Timur death in the Durrani throne passed down to his son Zaman Shah followed by Mahmud Shah Shuja Shah and others The Afghan Empire was under threat in the early century by the Persians in the west and the Sikhs in the east Fateh Khan leader of the Barakzai tribe had installed of his brothers in positions of power throughout the empire After his death they rebelled and divided up the provinces of the empire between themselves During this turbulent period Afghanistan had many temporary rulers until Dost Mohammad Khan declared himself emir in The Punjab region was lost to Ranjit Singh who invaded Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and in captured the city of Peshawar In during the Battle of Jamrud near the Khyber Pass Akbar Khan and the Afghan army killed Sikh Commander Hari Singh Nalwa By this time the British were advancing from the east and the first major conflict during the Great Game was initiated Western influence Following the defeat of the forces and victory of the Afghans the British established diplomatic relations with the Afghan government and withdrew all forces from the country They returned during the Second War in the late for about two years to assist Abdur Rahman Khan defeat Ayub Khan The United Kingdom began to exercise a great deal of influence after this and even controlled the state foreign policy In Mortimer Durand made Amir Abdur Rahman Khan sign a controversial agreement in which the ethnic Pashtun and Baloch territories were divided by the Durand Line This was a standard divide and rule policy of the British and would lead to strained relations especially with the later new state of Pakistan After the Third War and the signing of the Treaty of Rawalpindi in King Amanullah Khan declared Afghanistan a sovereign and fully independent state He moved to end his country traditional isolation by establishing diplomatic relations with the international community and following a tour of Europe and Turkey introduced several reforms intended to modernize his nation A key force behind these reforms was Mahmud Tarzi an ardent supporter of the education of women He fought for Article of Afghanistan constitution which made elementary education compulsory The institution of slavery was abolished in Some of the reforms that were actually put in place such as the abolition of the traditional burqa for women and the opening of a number of schools quickly alienated many tribal and religious leaders Faced with overwhelming armed opposition Amanullah Khan was forced to abdicate in January after Kabul fell to rebel forces led by Habibullah Kalakani Prince Mohammed Nadir Shah Amanullah cousin in turn defeated and killed Kalakani in November and was declared King Nadir Shah He abandoned the reforms of Amanullah Khan in favor of a more gradual approach to modernisation but was assassinated in by Abdul Khaliq a Hazara school student Mohammed Zahir Shah Nadir Shah son succeeded to the throne and reigned from to Until Zahir Shah ruled with the assistance of his uncle who held the post of Prime Minister and continued the policies of Nadir Shah Another of Zahir Shah uncles Shah Mahmud Khan became Prime Minister in and began an experiment allowing greater political freedom but reversed the policy when it went further than he expected He was replaced in by Mohammed Daoud Khan the king cousin and Daoud Khan sought a closer relationship with the Soviet Union and a more distant one towards Pakistan Afghanistan remained neutral and was neither a participant in World War II nor aligned with either power bloc in the Cold War However it was a beneficiary of the latter rivalry as both the Soviet Union and the United States vied for influence by building Afghanistan main highways airports and other vital infrastructure In while King Zahir Shah was on an official overseas visit Daoud Khan launched a bloodless coup and became the first President of Afghanistan In the meantime Zulfikar Ali Bhutto got neighboring Pakistan involved in Afghanistan Some experts suggest that Bhutto paved the way for the April Saur Revolution Marxist revolution and Soviet war In April the communist People Democratic Party of Afghanistan PDPA seized power in Afghanistan in the Saur Revolution Within months opponents of the communist government launched an uprising in eastern Afghanistan that quickly expanded into a civil war waged by guerrilla mujahideen against government forces countrywide The Pakistani government provided these rebels with covert training centers while the Soviet Union sent thousands of military advisers to support the PDPA government Meanwhile increasing friction between the competing factions of the PDPA the dominant Khalq and the more moderate Parcham resulted in the dismissal of Parchami cabinet members and the arrest of Parchami military officers under the pretext of a Parchami coup In September Nur Muhammad Taraki was assassinated in a coup within the PDPA orchestrated by fellow Khalq member Hafizullah Amin who assumed the presidency Distrusted by the Soviets Amin was assassinated by Soviet special forces in December A government led by Parcham Babrak Karmal but inclusive of both factions filled the vacuum Soviet troops were deployed to stabilize Afghanistan under Karmal in more substantial numbers although the Soviet government did not expect to do most of the fighting in Afghanistan As a result however the Soviets were now directly involved in what had been a domestic war in Afghanistan The PDPA prohibited usury declared equality of the sexes and introducing women to political life The United States has been supporting forces mujahideen as early as Billions in cash and weapons which included over two thousand Stinger missiles were provided by the United States and Saudi Arabia to Pakistan The Soviet war in Afghanistan resulted in the deaths of over million Afghans mostly civilians and the creation of about refugees who fled Afghanistan mainly to Pakistan and Iran Faced with mounting international pressure and numerous casualties the Soviets withdrew in but continued to support Afghan President Mohammad Najibullah until Civil war From until Najibullah government tried to solve the ongoing civil war without Soviet troops on the ground but with economic and military aid Najibullah tried to build support for his government and tried to portray his government as Islamic and in the constitution the country officially became an Islamic state and all references of communism were removed Nevertheless Najibullah did not win any significant support and with the dissolution of the Soviet Union in December he was left without foreign aid This coupled with the internal collapse of his government led to his ousting from power in April After the fall of Najibullah government in the Islamic State of Afghanistan was established by the Peshawar Accord a peace and agreement under which all the Afghan parties were united in April except for the Pakistani supported Islami of Gulbuddin Hekmatyar Hekmatyar started a bombardment campaign against the capital city Kabul which marked the beginning of a new phase in the war Saudi Arabia and Iran supported different Afghan militias and instability quickly developed The conflict between the two militias soon escalated into a war Due to the sudden initiation of the war working government departments police units and a system of justice and accountability for the newly created Islamic State of Afghanistan did not have time to form Atrocities were committed by individuals of the different armed factions while Kabul descended into lawlessness and chaos Because of the chaos some leaders increasingly had only nominal control over their sub commanders For civilians there was little security from murder rape and extortion An estimated people died during the most intense period of bombardment by Hekmatyar Islami and the Milli forces of Abdul Rashid Dostum who had created an alliance with Hekmatyar in Half a million people fled Afghanistan Southern and eastern Afghanistan were under the control of local commanders such as Gul Agha Sherzai and others In the Taliban a movement originating from Jamiat religious schools for Afghan refugees in Pakistan also developed in Afghanistan as a force The Taliban took control of Kabul and several provinces in southern and central Afghanistan in and forced the surrender of dozens of local Pashtun leaders In late forces of Ahmad Shah Massoud held on to Kabul and bombardment of the city came to a halt The Islamic State government took steps to open courts restore law and order and initiate a nationwide political process with the goal of national consolidation and democratic elections Massoud invited Taliban leaders to join the process but they refused Taliban Emirate and Northern Alliance The Taliban early victories in were followed by a series of defeats that resulted in heavy losses that led analysts to believe the Taliban movement had run its course The Taliban started shelling Kabul in early but were repelled by forces under Massoud On September as the Taliban with military support from Pakistan and financial support from Saudi Arabia prepared for another major offensive Massoud ordered a full retreat from Kabul The Taliban seized Kabul on September and established the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan They imposed on the parts of Afghanistan under their control their political and judicial interpretation of Islam issuing edicts especially targeting women According to Physicians for Human Rights PHR no other regime in the world has methodically and violently forced half of its population into virtual house arrest prohibiting them on pain of physical punishment After the fall of Kabul to the Taliban Massoud and Dostum created the United Front Northern Alliance The United Front included Massoud predominantly Tajik forces Dostum Uzbek forces and Hazara and Pashtun factions under leaders such as Haji Mohammad Mohaqiq Abdul Haq and Abdul Qadir The Taliban defeated Dostum forces during the Battles of The Taliban committed systematic massacres against civilians in northern and western Afghanistan Pakistan Chief of Army Staff Pervez Musharraf was responsible for sending tens of thousands of Pakistanis to fight alongside the Taliban and bin Laden against Northern Alliance forces In alone there were believed to be Pakistani nationals fighting inside Afghanistan From to the network of Osama bin Laden and Ayman was harbored by the Taliban in Afghanistan and bin Laden sent thousands of Arab recruits to fight against the United Front Massoud remained the only leader of the United Front in Afghanistan In the areas under his control Massoud set up democratic institutions and signed the Women Rights Declaration The fighting also caused around million people to flee Taliban controlled areas From to September Afghan civilians have reportedly died in the wars On September Massoud was assassinated by two Arab suicide attackers inside Afghanistan and two days later the September attacks were carried out in the United States The US government identified Osama bin Laden and as the perpetrators of the attacks and demanded that the Taliban hand over bin Laden After refusing to comply with the US demand the October Operation Enduring Freedom was launched During the initial invasion US and UK forces bombed parts of Afghanistan and worked with ground forces of the Northern Alliance to remove the Taliban from power and destroy training camps Recent history present In December after the Taliban government was toppled and the new Afghan government under Hamid Karzai was formed the International Security Assistance Force ISAF was established by the UN Security Council to help assist the Karzai administration and provide basic security Taliban forces also began regrouping inside Pakistan while more coalition troops entered Afghanistan and began rebuilding the country Shortly after their fall from power the Taliban began an insurgency to regain control of Afghanistan Over the next decade ISAF and Afghan troops led many offensives against the Taliban but failed to fully defeat them Afghanistan remained one of the poorest countries in the world due to a lack of foreign investment government corruption and the Taliban insurgency Meanwhile the Afghan government was able to build some democratic structures and on December the country changed its name

Osama bin Laden in Pakistan many prominent Afghan figures were assassinated Afghanistan Pakistan border skirmishes intensified and many large scale attacks by the Haqqani Network took place across Afghanistan The United States warned the Pakistani government of possible military action within Pakistan if the government refused to attack these forces in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas as
