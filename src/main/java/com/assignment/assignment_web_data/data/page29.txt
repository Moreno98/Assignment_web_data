Early in his career Agassi would look to end points quickly by playing first strike tennis typically by inducing a weak return with a deep hard shot and then playing a winner at an extreme angle His groundstrokes return of serve baseline game phenomenal coordination and keen sense of anticipation were always among the best in the game On the rare occasion that he charged the net Agassi liked to take the ball in the air and hit a swinging volley for the winner His favored groundstroke was his flat backhand hit well but in particular down the line His slightly spinnier forehand was nearly as strong in particular his forehand to the ad court Agassi strength was in dictating play from the back of the court While he was growing up his father and Nick Bollettieri trained him in this way When in control of a point Agassi would often pass up an opportunity to attempt a winner and hit a conservative shot to minimize his errors and to make his opponent run more This change to more methodical less aggressive baseline play was largely initiated by his longtime coach Brad Gilbert in their first year together in Gilbert encouraged Agassi to wear out opponents with his deep flat groundstrokes and to use his fitness to win attrition wars and noted Agassi backhand down the line as his very best shot A signature play later in his career was a change up drop shot to the deuce court after deep penetrating groundstrokes This would often be followed by a passing shot or lob if the opponent was fast enough to retrieve it Agassi serve was never the strength of his game but it improved steadily over the course of his career to being above average He often used his hard slice serve to the deuce service box to send his opponent off the court followed by a shot to the opposite corner Agassi service speed when hitting a flat first serve would range between His second serve usually was a heavy kick serve in the range Agassi was raised on hardcourts but found much of his early success on the red clay of Roland Garros reaching two consecutive finals there early in his career His first major win was at the slick grass of Wimbledon in a tournament that he professed to hating at the time
