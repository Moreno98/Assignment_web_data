Animation The bouncing ball animation below consists of these six frames This animation moves at frames per second Animation is the process of creating motion and shape change illusion by means of the rapid display of a sequence of static images that minimally differ from each other The illusion as in motion pictures in general is thought to rely on the phi phenomenon Animators are artists who specialize in the creation of animation Animations can be recorded on either analogue media such as a flip book motion picture film video tape or on digital media including formats such as animated GIF Flash animation or digital video To display animation a digital camera computer or projector are used along with new technologies that are produced Animation creation methods include the traditional animation creation method and those involving stop motion animation of two and objects such as paper cutouts puppets and clay figures Images are displayed in a rapid succession usually or frames per second Etymology From Latin anim ti the act of bringing to life from anim to animate or give life to and ti the act of History Early examples of attempts to capture the phenomenon of motion into a still drawing can be found in paleolithic cave paintings where animals are often depicted with multiple legs in superimposed positions clearly attempting to convey the perception of motion An earthen goblet discovered at the site of the Burnt City in southeastern Iran depicts what could possibly be the world s oldest example of animation The artifact bears five sequential images depicting a Persian Desert Ibex jumping up to eat the leaves of a tree Ancient Chinese records contain several mentions of devices that were said to give an impression of movement to human or animal figures but these accounts are unclear and may only refer to the actual movement of the figures through space In the century the phenakistoscope zoetrope and praxinoscope as well as the common flip book were early animation devices that produced an illusion of movement from a series of sequential drawings but animation did not develop further until the advent of motion picture film and cinematography in the The cin matographe was a projector printer and camera in one machine that allowed moving pictures to be shown successfully on a screen which was invented by history earliest film makers Auguste and Louis Lumi re in The first animated projection screening was created in France by Charles mile Reynaud who was a French science teacher Reynaud created the Praxinoscope in and the Th tre Optique in December On October he projected the first animation in public Pauvre Pierrot at the Mus e Gr vin in Paris This film is also notable as the first known instance of film perforations being used His films were not photographed but drawn directly onto the transparent strip In more than people had attended these screenings The first film that was recorded on standard picture film and included animated sequences was the Enchanted Drawing which was followed by the first entirely animated film the Humorous Phases of Funny Faces by Stuart Blackton who because of that is considered the father of American animation In Europe the French artist mile Cohl created the first animated film using what came to be known as traditional animation creation methods the Fantasmagorie The film largely consisted of a stick figure moving about and encountering all manner of morphing objects such as a wine bottle that transforms into a flower There were also sections of live action in which the animator s hands would enter the scene The film was created by drawing each frame on paper and then shooting each frame onto negative film which gave the picture a blackboard look The author of the first film The Beautiful Lukanida was the ethnically Polish director Wladyslaw Starewicz known as Ladislas Starevich The more detailed animations requiring a team of animators drawing each frame manually with detailed backgrounds and characters were those directed by Winsor McCay a successful newspaper cartoonist including the Little Nemo the Gertie the Dinosaur and the The Sinking of the Lusitania During the the production of animated short films typically referred to as cartoons became an industry of its own and cartoon shorts were produced for showing in movie theaters The most successful producer at the time was John Randolph Bray who along with animator Earl Hurd patented the cel animation process which dominated the animation industry for the rest of the decade El Ap stol Spanish The Apostle was a Argentine animated film utilizing cutout animation and the world first animated feature film Unfortunately a fire that destroyed producer Frederico Valle film studio incinerated the only known copy of El Ap stol and it is now considered a lost film Computer animation has become popular since Toy Story the first animated film completely made using this technique In the animation market was worth billion Animation as an art and industry continues to thrive as of the because animated projects can find audiences across borders and in all four quadrants Animated films returned the highest gross margins around of all film genres in the timeframe Techniques Traditional animation Traditional animation also called cel animation or animation was the process used for most animated films of the century The individual frames of a traditionally animated film are photographs of drawings first drawn on paper To create the illusion of movement each drawing differs slightly from the one before it The animators drawings are traced or photocopied onto transparent acetate sheets called cels which are filled in with paints in assigned colors or tones on the side opposite the line drawings The completed character cels are photographed against a painted background by a rostrum camera onto motion picture film The traditional cel animation process became obsolete by the beginning of the century Today animators drawings and the backgrounds are either scanned into or drawn directly into a computer system Various software programs are used to color the drawings and simulate camera movement and effects The final animated piece is output to one of several delivery media including traditional mm film and newer media such as digital video The look of traditional cel animation is still preserved and the character animators work has remained essentially the same over the past years Some animation producers have used the term tradigital to describe cel animation which makes extensive use of computer technology Examples of traditionally animated feature films include Pinocchio United States Animal Farm United Kingdom and The Illusionist Traditionally animated films which were produced with the aid of computer technology include The Lion King US Akira Japan Spirited Away Japan The Triplets of Belleville France and The Secret of Kells Stop motion animation animation is used to describe animation created by physically manipulating objects and photographing them one frame of film at a time to create the illusion of movement There are many different types of animation usually named after the medium used to create the animation Computer software is widely available to create this type of animation however traditional stop motion animation is usually less expensive and to produce than current computer animation Computer animation Computer animation encompasses a variety of techniques the unifying factor being that the animation is created digitally on a computer animation techniques tend to focus on image manipulation while techniques usually build virtual worlds in which characters and objects move and interact animation can create images that seem real to the viewer animation animation figures are created edited on the computer using bitmap graphics or created and edited using vector graphics This includes automated computerized versions of traditional animation techniques such as interpolated morphing onion skinning and interpolated rotoscoping animation has many applications including analog computer animation Flash animation and PowerPoint animation Cinemagraphs are still photographs in the form of an animated GIF file of which part is animated animation animation is digitally modeled and manipulated by an animator The animator usually starts by creating a polygon mesh to manipulate A mesh typically includes many vertices that are connected by edges and faces to give the visual appearance of form to a object or environment Sometimes the mesh is given an internal digital skeletal structure called an armature that can be used to control the mesh by weighting the vertices This process is called rigging and can be used in conjunction with keyframes to create movement Other techniques can be applied such as mathematical functions gravity particle simulations simulated fur or hair and effects such as fire and water simulations These techniques fall under the category of dynamics Production The creation of animation works longer than a few seconds has developed as a form of filmmaking but with certain unique aspects One thing and animated films do have in common is that they are both extremely and have high production costs The most important difference is that once a film is in the production phase the marginal cost of one more shot is much much higher for animated films than for films It is relatively easy for a director to ask for one more take during principal photography of a film but every take on an animated film must be manually rendered by animators although the task of rendering slightly different takes has been made less tedious by modern computer animation It is pointless for a studio to pay the salaries of dozens of animators to spend weeks creating a visually dazzling scene if that scene fails to effectively advance the plot of the film Thus animation studios starting with Disney began the practice in the of maintaining story departments where storyboard artists develop every single scene through storyboards then handing the film over to the animators only after the production team is satisfied that all the scenes will make sense as a whole While films are now also storyboarded they necessarily enjoy much more latitude to depart from storyboards improvisation Another problem unique to animation is the necessity of ensuring that the style of an animated film is consistent from start to finish even as films have grown longer and teams have grown larger Animators like all artists necessarily have their own individual styles but must subordinate their individuality in a consistent way to whatever style was selected for a particular film Since the early animated films have been created by teams of about to people of whom to are animators It is relatively easy for two or three artists to match each other styles but it is much harder to keep dozens of artists synchronized with one another This problem is usually solved by having a separate group of visual development artists develop an overall look and palette for each film before animation begins Character designers on the visual development team draw model sheets to show how each character should look like with different facial expressions posed in different positions and viewed from different angles On traditionally animated projects maquettes were often sculpted to further help the animators see how characters would look from different angles Unlike films animated films were traditionally developed beyond the synopsis stage through the storyboard format the storyboard artists would then receive credit for writing the film In the early animation studios began hiring professional screenwriters to write screenplays while also continuing to use story departments and such screenplays had become commonplace for animated films by the late Awards As with any other form of media animation too has instituted awards for excellence in the field The original awards for animation were presented by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for animated shorts from the year during the Academy Awards function The first winner of the Academy Award was the short Flowers and Trees a production by Walt Disney Productions and United Artists However the Academy Award for a animated motion picture was only instituted for the year and awarded during the Academy Awards in It was won by the movie Shrek produced by DreamWorks and Pacific Data Images Since then have produced the most movies either to win or be nominated for the award The list of both awards can be obtained here Several other countries have instituted an award for best animated feature film as part of their national film awards BAFTA Award for Best Animated Film since C sar Award for Best Animated Film since Goya Award for Best Animated Film since Japan Academy Prize for Animation of the Year since Also since the Asia Pacific Screen Award for Best Animated Feature Film has been awarded at the Asia Pacific Screen Awards Since the European Film Awards have awarded the European Film Award for Best Animated Film The Annie Award is another award presented for excellence in the field of animation Unlike the Academy Awards the Annie Awards are only received for achievements in the field of animation and not for any other field of technical and artistic endeavor They were in to create a new field for Best Animated feature The winners were dominated by Walt Disney however newer studios led by Pixar DreamWorks have now begun to consistently vie for this award The list of awardees is as follows
