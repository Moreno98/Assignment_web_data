Altruism Altruism or selflessness is the principle or practice of concern for the welfare of others It is a traditional virtue in many cultures and a core aspect of various religious traditions and secular worldviews though the concept of others toward whom concern should be directed can vary among cultures and religions Altruism or selflessness is the opposite of selfishness The word was coined by the French philosopher Auguste Comte in French as altruisme for an antonym of egoism He derived it from an Italian altrui which in turn was derived from Latin alteri meaning other people or somebody else Altruism in biological organisms can be defined as an individual performing an action which is at a cost to themselves pleasure and quality of life time probability of survival or reproduction but benefits either directly or indirectly another individual without the expectation of reciprocity or compensation for that action Altruism can be distinguished from feelings of loyalty in that whilst the latter is predicated upon social relationships altruism does not consider relationships Much debate exists as to whether true altruism is possible in human psychology The theory of psychological egoism suggests that no act of sharing helping or sacrificing can be described as truly altruistic as the actor may receive an intrinsic reward in the form of personal gratification The validity of this argument depends on whether intrinsic rewards qualify as benefits The term altruism may also refer to an ethical doctrine that claims that individuals are morally obliged to benefit others Used in this sense it is usually contrasted with egoism which is defined as acting to the benefit of one self The notion of altruism The concept has a long history in philosophical and ethical thought The term was originally coined in the century by the founding sociologist and philosopher of science Auguste Comte and has become a major topic for psychologists especially evolutionary psychology researchers evolutionary biologists and ethologists Whilst ideas about altruism from one field can have an impact on the other fields the different methods and focuses of these fields always lead to different perspectives on altruism In simple terms altruism is caring about the welfare of other people and acting to help them Individual variations A certain individual may behave altruistically in one case and egotistically in another situation However some individuals tend to behave more altruistically while others tend to behave more egotistically Altruism may be considered a general attitude to the point where altruism has been considered as a trait A study estimated that altruism was Another study by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology was published in Also based on the twin design the new study estimated that genetic differences accounted for approximately of individual variations Scientific viewpoints Anthropology Marcel Mauss book The Gift contains a passage Note on alms This note describes the evolution of the notion of alms and by extension of altruism from the notion of sacrifice In it he writes Alms are the fruits of a moral notion of the gift and of fortune on the one hand and of a notion of sacrifice on the other Generosity is an obligation because Nemesis avenges the poor and the gods for the superabundance of happiness and wealth of certain people who should rid themselves of it This is the ancient morality of the gift which has become a principle of justice The gods and the spirits accept that the share of wealth and happiness that has been offered to them and had been hitherto destroyed in useless sacrifices should serve the poor and children Evolutionary explanations In the science of ethology the study of animal behaviour and more generally in the study of social evolution altruism refers to behaviour by an individual that increases the fitness of another individual while decreasing the fitness of the actor In evolutionary psychology this may be applied to a wide range of human behaviors such as charity emergency aid help to coalition partners tipping courtship gifts production of public goods and environmentalism Theories of apparently altruistic behavior were accelerated by the need to produce theories compatible with evolutionary origins Two related strands of research on altruism have emerged from traditional evolutionary analyses and from evolutionary game theory a mathematical model and analysis of behavioural strategies Some of the proposed mechanisms are Such explanations do not imply that humans are always consciously calculating how to increase their inclusive fitness when they are doing altruistic acts Instead evolution has shaped psychological mechanisms such as emotions that promote altruistic behaviors Every single instance of altruistic behavior need not always increase inclusive fitness altruistic behaviors would have been selected for if such behaviors on average increased inclusive fitness in the ancestral environment This need not imply that on average or more of altruistic acts were beneficial for the altruist in the ancestral environment if the benefits from helping the right person were very high it would be beneficial to err on the side of caution and usually be altruistic even if in most cases there were no benefits The benefits for the altruist may be increased and the costs reduced by being more altruistic towards certain groups Research has found that people are more altruistic to kin than to to friends than to strangers to those attractive than to those unattractive to than to competitors and to members ingroups than to members of outgroup The study of altruism was the initial impetus behind George Price development of the Price equation which is a mathematical equation used to study genetic evolution An interesting example of altruism is found in the cellular slime moulds such as Dictyostelium mucoroides These protists live as individual amoebae until starved at which point they aggregate and form a multicellular fruiting body in which some cells sacrifice themselves to promote the survival of other cells in the fruiting body Selective investment theory proposes that close social bonds and associated emotional cognitive and neurohormonal mechanisms evolved in order to facilitate altruism between those closely depending on one another for survival and reproductive success Such cooperative behaviors have sometimes been seen as arguments for politics such by the Russian zoologist and anarchist Peter Kropotkin in his book and Peter Singer in his book A Darwinian Left Most recently Jeremy Griffith has proposed a biological theory for the development of truly altruistic instincts that accommodates the biological imperative to reproduce as evidenced by a moral conscience visible in humans today Neurobiology Jorge Moll and Jordan Grafman neuroscientists at the National Institutes of Health and Hospital Network provided the first evidence for the neural bases of altruistic giving in normal healthy volunteers using functional magnetic resonance imaging In their research published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA in October they showed that both pure monetary rewards and charitable donations activated the mesolimbic reward pathway a primitive part of the brain that usually lights up in response to food and sex However when volunteers generously placed the interests of others before their own by making charitable donations another brain circuit was selectively activated the subgenual region These structures are intimately related to social attachment and bonding in other species Altruism the experiment suggested was not a superior moral faculty that suppresses basic selfish urges but rather was basic to the brain and pleasurable Another experiment funded by the National Institutes of Health and conducted in at the Duke University in Durham North Carolina suggests a different view that altruistic behavior may originate from how people view the world rather than how they act in it In the study published in the February print issue of Nature Neuroscience researchers have found a part of the brain that behaves differently for altruistic and selfish people The researchers invited volunteers to play a computer game and also to watch the computer play the game In some rounds the game resulted in the volunteers winning money for themselves and in others it resulted in money being donated to a charity of the volunteer choice During these activities the researchers took functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI scans of the participants brains and were surprised by the results Although they were expecting to see activity in the brain reward centers based on the idea that people perform altruistic acts because they feel good about it what they found was that another part of the brain was also involved and it was quite sensitive to the difference between doing something for personal gain and doing it for someone else gain That part of the brain is called the posterior superior temporal cortex pSTC In the next stage the scientists asked the participants some questions about type and frequency of their altruistic or helping behaviours They then analysed the responses to generate an estimate of a person tendency to act altruistically and compared each person level of altruism against their fMRI brain scan The results showed that pSTC activity rose in proportion to a person level of altruism According to the researchers the results suggest that altruistic behavior may originate from how people view the world rather than how they act in it We believe that the ability to perceive other people actions as meaningful is critical for altruism said lead study investigator Dharol Tankersley Psychology The International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences defines psychological altruism as a motivational state with the goal of increasing another s welfare Psychological altruism is contrasted with psychological egoism which refers to the motivation to increase one s own welfare There has been some debate on whether or not humans are truly capable of psychological altruism Some definitions specify a nature to altruism and a lack of external rewards for altruistic behaviors However because altruism ultimately benefits the self in many cases the selflessness of altruistic acts is brought to question The social exchange theory postulates that altruism only exists when benefits outweigh costs Daniel Batson is a psychologist who examined this question and argues against the social exchange theory He identified four major motives for altruism altruism to ultimately benefit the self egoism to ultimately benefit the other person altruism to benefit a group collectivism or to uphold a moral principle principlism Altruism that ultimately serves selfish gains is thus differentiated from selfless altruism but the general conclusion has been that altruism can be genuinely selfless The hypothesis basically states that psychological altruism does exist and is evoked by the empathic desire to help someone who is suffering Feelings of empathic concern are contrasted with feelings of personal distress which compel people to reduce their own unpleasant emotions People with empathic concern help others in distress even when exposure to the situation could be easily avoided whereas those lacking in empathic concern avoid helping unless it is difficult or impossible to avoid exposure to another suffering Helping behavior is seen in humans at about two years old when a toddler is capable of understanding subtle emotional cues In psychological research on altruism studies often observe altruism as demonstrated through prosocial behaviors such as helping comforting sharing cooperation philanthropy and community service Research has found that people are most likely to help if they recognize that a person is in need and feel personal responsibility for reducing the person distress Research also suggests that the number of bystanders witnessing distress or suffering affects the likelihood of helping the Bystander effect Greater numbers of bystanders decrease individual feelings of responsibility However a witness with a high level of empathic concern is likely to assume personal responsibility entirely regardless of the number of bystanders A feeling of personal responsibility or moral norm has also strongly been associated with other behaviors such as charitable giving Many studies have observed the effects of volunteerism as a form of altruism on happiness and health and have consistently found a strong connection between volunteerism and current and future health and In a study of older adults those who volunteered were significantly higher on life satisfaction and will to live and significantly lower in depression anxiety and somatization Volunteerism and helping behavior have not only been shown to improve mental health but physical health and longevity as well One study examined the physical health of mothers who volunteered over a period and found that of those who did not belong to a volunteer organization experienced a major illness while only of those who did volunteer experienced one A study on adults ages found that during the study period people who volunteered for two or more organizations had a lower likelihood of dying After controlling for prior health status it was determined that volunteerism accounted for a reduction in mortality Merely being aware of kindness in oneself and others is also associated with greater A study that asked participants to count each act of kindness they performed for one week significantly enhanced their subjective happiness It is important to note that while research supports the idea that altruistic acts bring about happiness it has also been found to work in the opposite direction that happier people are also kinder The relationship between altruistic behavior and happiness is bidirectional Studies have found that generosity increases linearly from sad to happy affective states Studies have also been careful to note that feeling by the needs of others has conversely negative effects on health and happiness For example one study on volunteerism found that feeling overwhelmed by others demands had an even stronger negative effect on mental health than helping had a positive one although positive effects were still significant Additionally while generous acts make people feel good about themselves it is also important for people to appreciate the kindness they receive from others Studies suggest that gratitude goes with kindness and is also very important for our A study on the relationship happiness to various character strengths showed that a conscious focus on gratitude led to reductions in negative affect and increases in optimistic appraisals positive affect offering emotional support sleep quality and Psychologists generally refer to this virtuous cycle of helping others doing good and subsequently feeling good as the helper high Sociology Sociologists have long been concerned with how to build the good society Altruism Morality and Social Solidarity American Sociological Association The structure of our societies and how individuals come to exhibit charitable philanthropic and other altruistic actions for the common good is a largely researched topic within the field The American Sociology Association ASA acknowledges Public sociology saying The intrinsic scientific policy and public relevance of this field of investigation in helping to construct good societies is unquestionable Altruism Morality and Social Solidarity ASA This type of sociology seeks contributions that aid grassroots and theoretical understandings of what motivates altruism and how it is organized and promotes an altruistic focus in order to benefit the world and people it studies How altruism is framed organized carried out and what motivates it at the group level is an area of focus that sociologists seek to investigate in order to contribute back to the groups it studies and build the good society Religious viewpoints Most if not all of the world religions promote altruism as a very important moral value Buddhism Christianity Hinduism Islam Jainism Judaism and Sikhism place particular emphasis on altruistic morality Buddhism Altruism figures prominently in Buddhism Love and compassion are components of all forms of Buddhism and are focused on all beings equally love is the wish that all beings be happy and compassion is the wish that all beings be free from suffering Many illnesses can be cured by the one medicine of love and compassion These qualities are the ultimate source of human happiness and the need for them lies at the very core of our being Dalai Lama Since all beings includes the individual love and compassion in Buddhism are outside the opposition between self and other It is even said that the distinction between self and other is part of the root cause of our suffering In practical terms however since most of us are spontaneously Buddhism encourages us to focus love and compassion on others and thus can be characterized as altruistic Many would agree with the Dalai Lama that Buddhism as a religion is kindness toward others Still the notion of altruism is modified in such a since the belief is that such a practice promotes our own happiness The more we care for the happiness of others the greater our own sense of becomes Dalai Lama In the context of larger ethical discussions on moral action and judgment Buddhism is characterized by the belief that negative unhappy consequences of our actions derive not from punishment or correction based on moral judgment but from the law of karma which functions like a natural law of cause and effect A simple illustration of such cause and effect is the case of experiencing the effects of what I cause if I cause suffering then as a natural consequence I will experience suffering if I cause happiness then as a natural consequence I will experience happiness In Buddhism karma P li kamma is strictly distinguished from vip ka meaning fruit or result Karma is categorized within the group or groups of cause P li hetu in the chain of cause and effect where it comprises the elements of volitional activities Pali sankhara and action Pali bhava Any action is understood to create seeds in the mind that sprout into the appropriate results P li vipaka when they meet the right conditions Most types of karmas with good or bad results will keep one in the wheel of sams ra others will liberate one to nirv na Buddhism relates karma directly to motives behind an action Motivation usually makes the difference between good and bad but motivation also includes the aspect of ignorance so a action from an ignorant mind can easily be bad in that it creates unpleasant results for the actor In Buddhism karma is not the only cause of all that happens As taught in the early texts the commentarial tradition classified causal mechanisms governing the universe in five categories known as Niyama Dhammas Jainism The fundamental principles of Jainism revolve around the concept of altruism not only for humans but for all sentient beings Jainism preaches the view of Ahimsa to live and let live thereby not harming sentient beings uncompromising reverence for all life It also considers all living things to be equal The first Thirthankar Rishabh introduced the concept of altruism for all living beings from extending knowledge and experience to others to donation giving oneself up for others and compassion for all living things Jainism prescribes a path of to progress the soul to this ultimate goal Jains believe that to attain enlightenment and ultimately liberation one must practice the following ethical principles major vows in thought speech and action The degree to which these principles are practiced is different for householders and monks They are A major characteristic of Jain belief is the emphasis on the consequences of not only physical but also mental behaviors One unconquered mind with anger pride ego deceit greed and uncontrolled sense organs are the powerful enemies of humans Anger spoils good relations pride destroys humility deceit destroys peace and greed destroys everything Jainism recommends conquering anger by forgiveness pride ego by humility deceit by and greed by contentment The principle of seeks to minimize karmas which limit the capabilities of the soul Jainism views every soul as worthy of respect because it has the potential to become Siddha highest soul Because all living beings possess a soul great care and awareness is essential in one actions Jainism emphasizes the equality of all life advocating harmlessness towards all whether the creatures are great or small This policy extends even to microscopic organisms Jainism acknowledges that every person has different capabilities and capacities to practice and therefore accepts different levels of compliance for ascetics and householders The great vows mahavrata are prescribed for monks and limited vows anuvrata are prescribed for householders In other words the are encouraged to practice the five cardinal principles of truthfulness celibacy and with their current practical limitations while the monks have to observe them very strictly With consistent practice it will be possible to overcome the limitations gradually accelerating the spiritual progress Christianity Altruism is central to the teachings of Jesus found in the Gospel especially in the Sermon on the Mount and the Sermon on the Plain From biblical to medieval Christian traditions tensions between and were sometimes discussed under the heading of disinterested love as in the Pauline phrase love seeks not its own interests In his book Indoctrination and Roderick Hindery tries to shed light on these tensions by contrasting them with impostors of authentic and altruism by analysis of within creative individuation of the self and by contrasting love for the few with love for the many Love confirms others in their freedom shuns propaganda and masks assures others of its presence and is ultimately confirmed not by mere declarations from others but by each person experience and practice from within As in practical arts the presence and meaning of love becomes validated and grasped not by words and reflections alone but in the making of the connection St Thomas Aquinas interprets You should love your neighbour as yourself as meaning that love for ourselves is the exemplar of love for others Considering that the love with which a man loves himself is the form and root of friendship and quotes Aristotle that the origin of friendly relations with others lies in our relations to ourselves he concluded that though we are not bound to love others more than ourselves we naturally seek the common good the good of the whole more than any private good the good of a part However he thinks we should love God more than ourselves and our neighbours and more than our bodily life since the ultimate purpose of loving our neighbour is to share in eternal beatitude a more desirable thing than bodily well being In coining the word Altruism as stated above Comte was probably opposing this Thomistic doctrine which is present in some theological schools within Catholicism Many biblical authors draw a strong connection between love of others and love of God John states that for one to love God one must love his fellowman and that hatred of one fellowman is the same as hatred of God Thomas Jay Oord has argued in several books that altruism is but one possible form of love An altruistic action is not always a loving action Oord defines altruism as acting for the other good and he agrees with feminists who note that sometimes love requires acting for one own good when the other demands undermine overall German philosopher Max Scheler distinguishes two ways in which the strong can help the weak One way is a sincere expression of Christian love motivated by a powerful feeling of security strength and inner salvation of the invincible fullness of one s own life and existence Another way is merely one of the many modern substitutes for love nothing but the urge to turn away from oneself and to lose oneself in other people s business At its worst Scheler says love for the small the poor the weak and the oppressed is really disguised hatred repressed envy an impulse to detract directed against the opposite phenomena wealth strength power largesse Islam In Islam the concept th r altruism is the notion of preferring others to oneself For Sufis this means devotion to others through complete forgetfulness of one own concerns where concern for others is rooted to be a demand made by Allah on the human body considered to be property of Allah alone The importance lies in sacrifice for the sake of the greater good Islam considers those practicing th r as abiding by the highest degree of nobility This is similar to the notion of chivalry but unlike that European concept in i thar attention is focused on everything in existence A constant concern for Allah God results in a careful attitude towards people animals and other things in this world This concept was emphasized by Sufis of Islam like Rabia who paid attention to the difference between dedication to Allah God and dedication to people Turkish Sufi poet Yunus Emre explained this philosophy as Yarat lan severiz Yaratandan t r or We love the creature because of The Creator For many Muslims i thar must be practiced as a religious obligation during specific Islamic holidays However i thar is also still an Islamic ideal to which all Muslims should strive to adhere at all times Judaism Judaism defines altruism as the desired goal of creation The famous Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook stated that love is the most important attribute in humanity This is defined as bestowal or giving which is the intention of altruism This can be altruism towards humanity that leads to altruism towards the creator or God Kabbalah defines God as the force of giving in existence Rabbi Moshe Chaim Luzzatto in particular focused on the purpose of creation and how the will of God was to bring creation into perfection and adhesion with this upper force Modern Kabbalah developed by Rabbi Yehuda Ashlag in his writings about the future generation focuses on how society could achieve an altruistic social framework Ashlag proposed that such a framework is the purpose of creation and everything that happens is to raise humanity to the level of altruism love for one another Ashlag focused on society and its relation to divinity Sikhism Altruism is essential to the Sikh religion The central faith in Sikhism is that the greatest deed any one can do is to imbibe and live the godly qualities like love affection sacrifice patience harmony truthfulness The fifth Nanak Guru Arjun Dev Sacrificed his life to uphold carats of pure truth the greatest gift to humanity the Guru Granth The ninth Nanak Guru Tegh Bahadur sacrificed his head to protect weak and defenseless people against atrocity In the late sventeenth century Guru Gobind Singh Ji the tenth guru in Sikhism was in war with the Moghul rulers to protect the people of different faiths when a fellow Sikh Bhai Kanhaiya attended the troops of the enemy He gave water to both friends and foes who were wounded on the battlefield Some of the enemy began to fight again and some Sikh warriors were annoyed by Bhai Kanhaiya as he was helping their enemy Sikh soldiers brought Bhai Kanhaiya before Guru Gobind Singh Ji and complained of his action that they considered to their struggle on the battlefield What were you doing and why asked the Guru I was giving water to the wounded because I saw your face in all of them replied Bhai Kanhaiya The Guru responded Then you should also give them ointment to heal their wounds You were practicing what you were coached in the house of the Guru It was under the tutelage of the Guru that Bhai Kanhaiya subsequently founded a volunteer corps for altruism This volunteer corps still to date is engaged in doing good to others and trains new volunteering recruits for doing the same Hinduism Swami Sivananda an Advaita scholar reiterates the same views in his commentary synthesising Vedanta views on the Brahma Sutras a Vedantic text In his commentary on Chapter of the Brahma Sutras Sivananda notes that karma is insentient and and ceases to exist as soon as a deed is executed Hence karma can not bestow the fruits of actions at a future date according to one merit Furthermore one can not argue that karma generates apurva or punya which gives fruit Since apurva is it can not act unless moved by an intelligent being such as a god It can not independently bestow reward or punishment Philosophy There exists a wide range of philosophical views on man obligations or motivations to act altruistically Proponents of ethical altruism maintain that individuals are morally obligated to act altruistically The opposing view is ethical egoism which maintains that moral agents should always act in their own Both ethical altruism and ethical egoism contrast with utilitarianism which is the view that every individual including one own is of equal moral importance A related concept in descriptive ethics is psychological egoism the thesis that humans always act in their own and that true altruism is impossible Rational egoism is the view that rationality consists in acting in one without specifying how this affects one moral obligations
